WHAT IS HAPPENIIIIING!?!,"Listen, I'm as philosophically liberal as the next millennial, but I gotta gripe about this one with the risk of some nutty ""Bernie Boy"" throwing hate at me, anyway ...

...I just heard this official Bernie Sanders campaign surrogate on MSNBC say that ""no one can EARN a billion dollars"" and that when billionaires get rich every dollar they make is a dollar less that a poor person makes. 

SERIOUSLY?? That is the exact opposite of sound economic theory taught by every economist. I am totally on board with substantially increasing income or capital gains taxes on the uber rich, but to shame people for coming up with an earth shaking invention or groundbreaking business model is absolutely insane.

Its arrogant uneducated comments like that on behalf of Democratic candidates which Fox News makes clips out of and scares their audience with. This type of shit WILL get Trump reelected. 

The Democratic primary is turning into more of a disaster than 2016. Let's just cannibalize each other and get the circular firing squad over with.

Thoughts On Scientific Racism?,"I've recently been seeing in the past few years arguing more and more about things like ""Race and IQ"" (which literally end up concluding blacks are innately dumber than whites aka actual racism) so i want all of you to show how this can be combated/disproved.

Scientific racism was used way back to claim blacks were unworthy of being part of general society and were deserving of segregation. I have heard modern proponents of this kind of weird gene sh*t literally defend segregationists and segregation itself.

My Vote for Elizabeth Warren,"Last Saturday, I took advantage of early voting for the 2020 Primary for a Super Tuesday state. After much thought and deliberation, I cast my ballot for Elizabeth Warren.  There were several excellent candidates, and I will vow to support anyone of them in the fall.  But in the end, I decided that Senator Warren would make the best President from the Democratic field.

Time and time again, she has shown the be the smartest person on the stage.  She has offered more than just ideas, but detailed plans and a realistic approach to how to achieve them.  But it is more than that.  She demonstrates an empathy with the American people, that she understands what we are going through.  She can turn almost any debate point into a story about people on the street.  On Main Street that is.  She has taken on Wall Street by leading the charge for the Consumer Protection Bureau.  Warren is a planner.  She‚Äôs the person that could tackle rising health care costs, education costs and have a plan to get to the end.  She is who I would want to lead the US during a potential public health crisis like COVID-19 or during hurricane season or, well, any kind of crisis.  Let‚Äôs make the Presidency competent again.  

Of the one million debates thus far, she has consistently been one of the best performers.  Probably the winner of 90% of them.  In taking down Mike Bloomberg, she showed that she was a fighter ruthlessly demolishing an out-of-touch billionaire.  You may remember that she also destroyed John Delaney before he even got off the ground with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can‚Äôt do and shouldn‚Äôt fight for.‚Äù  I could easily see her on the debate stage against Trump and utterly demolish him.  She, better than anyone, could attack Trump‚Äôs corruption and cruelty on the debate stage, leaving him with only a racial epithet as a rebuttal.

Before casting my vote, I debated with myself who I should pick.  I struggled to choose because they were all good in some way.  We all worry about the ‚Äúelectability‚Äù issue.  I took some quizzes like the WaPo and isidewith.com.  My answers generally aligned with Mayor Pete and Amy Klobachar more than Warren. But I was within 4% of most candidates.  So there has to be something else more than just agreeing on a quiz.  A Presidential election is a job interview.  A feeling that this is the person for the job. I like Senator Klobachar, but she just never really got off the ground.  But my choice really came down to Warren vs Pete. I hovered over both ovals for longer than I expected.  When it came down to it, I may like Pete but he doesn‚Äôt have the resume for me quite yet.  I hope he runs for Governor or Senator for his state and can turn this into a larger platform.  But his time isn‚Äôt now.  Maybe 2024 or 2028.  But for 2020, I came to select Elizabeth Warren. 

For the other candidates, they are all fine and good and would make a far better President than the current office holder.  I had wished Booker and Harris could have stuck around longer.  Booker just never really caught on in this cycle. And while Harris made a splash early on, she seemed to always have to walk back her remarks in the debates.  But had Harris made it to Super Tuesday, I think I could have had an even more difficult decision between the three. 

In the end, make sure your voice is heard.  You don‚Äôt have to write a page about who you picked an why. But speak with your vote. The polls may give us an idea of what people are thinking, but Super Tuesday is when those thoughts matter. Go Vote!",Liberal,1583075108,deaconheel,11,1,True,2020-03-01

"Hello everyone, I just read this article that I thought you and I should both share. Please read it. I find it detrimental to public health during this time of crisis and I want to shed light on that.","https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2020/3/9/21171371/ted-cruz-coronavirus-trump

This article points out some of the most infuriating things that could possibly be used in defense of Trump. The author, Sean Collins, has significantly downplayed the severity of the coronavirus and is succeeding at his job: to attract republican views. Things in the article like this:

‚ÄúFor example, US diplomat **Mick Mulvaney** ‚Äî who at the time was the acting White House chief of staff ‚Äî told attendees, **‚ÄúThe reason you‚Äôre seeing so much attention to [the coronavirus] today is that [Democrats] think this is going to be what brings down the president. That‚Äôs what this is all about.**‚Äù‚Äù-Sean Collins, Vox. 

Collins then goes on to praise the president for being extraordinarily sanitary. 

‚ÄúThat Cruz, Gosar, and Collins had concerning contact at CPAC is striking considering many of the conference‚Äôs speakers worked to, as President Donald Trump has done, minimize the seriousness of the virus.‚Äù -Sean Collins, Vox. 

Mind you, this is *after* Trump publicly kissed a flag that has definitely been handled by many other people. The fact that it‚Äôs next to the president at all means that it has never once been dropped on the ground. Which, of course, means it‚Äôs been held carefully. 

The right wing is being influenced into paranoia about the left wing of the US wanting the virus to kill the president. While the left may *want* Trump to pass away, the argument made by Mulvaney is igniting unnecessary hatred, as I consistently see posts from the NYTimes and other more-liberal sources saying things about obtaining masks AND even asking themselves within the headline if a mask *can* help. The left doesn‚Äôt want anybody to get sick. We all know that but the right doesn‚Äôt. 

Now, personally, after my nearby hospital, John Muir, sent out an email saying they will no longer take walk-ins and will be doing over-the-phone screenings, I‚Äôm going to start carrying hand sanitizer for myself and using rubber gloves at the gas station. (I already do, I just wanted to make it sound easy so you‚Äôll do it too.) **That doesn‚Äôt mean I want the virus to KILL the PRESIDENT.** 

Sidebar: Try to not touch your face without using soap first, and
#if you have to cough, cough in your ELBOW. Not your hand. 

I added that paragraph to help emphasize this one. There must be media that is shown exclusively to the right wing through data tracking. There must be, right? An entire wing of US politics can not be this oblivious without an external influences, right? Somewhere, someone, is making money by doing this to us. 

How can a publisher just write an article capable of turning America against itself, during the panic of a pandemic? It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting, if not treasonous, for pushing us closer and closer to our second Civil War.

Listen everybody, I don‚Äôt want your upvotes, I don‚Äôt want to hear why Sean Collins is innocent, I just want you to repost the article. Something fishy is going on with our media and I‚Äôm not fighting a civil war over Donald and COVID-19. If we share this enough, the right wing will see the truth and may even show us proof that this wild theory is true.

I Feel Like I Need to Say This Out Loud,"So here's the thing.  I'm a huge Elvis Fan.  The day i found out that he died before I was born, I literally cried.  That's how much of a fan of The King I am.  Why do we care about this in a liberal subreddit? You may be thinking...And I will tell you......

Because if Elvis Freaking Presley had showed up alive in 2015, and ran for president, and i voted for him bc like I said, love him (and yes i know someone will have something to say for that as well), were he the one who had marched off to Washington D.C. and promptly began to make an absolute jackass of himself while tearing families apart at the border all over some wall that's falling apart faster than they can get it put up, put more effort into wiping out the previous administrations agenda than any effort he put into an honest agenda of his own, almost started a war bc he just felt like taking out a high ranking general of a country we were not even at war with(sorry but that plane going down to me is on Trumps head and always will be.), and for brevity's sake I'm just going to cut to this week,  where they now have proof that he had his administration scrap a CDC warning about the coronavirus,  telling elderly people (as in grandpa and grandma, people)  not to fly to avoid contracting COVID-19, BC he didn't want it to affect the stock market if they stopped buying airplanes tickets... if it were Elvis who had done this, if it were Mother Freaking Theresa,  who had done this...if it were Puff the magic dragon with superman and Mr. Rogers who had done this, I would be raising holy hell about them instead of about Trump!! So many people have started picking at my posts as though I'm treating this man unfairly,  and the truth is,  he hasn't treated the USA fairly since the day he was inaugurated!  The first thing he said when he sat down at a table with his administration and the Congress, was to lie and say that he actually won the popular vote,  that they had proved voter frauds with over one million votes.  Nancy Pelosi immediately called him out on it. Started straight out the gate with a provable lie.  
I genuinely feel for Trump, bc he has been brought up by a family of grifters who believe if you're not rich and perfect, you're nothing.  They're these perfectly coiffed mannequins filled to the brim with shiny gold coins,  but what happens to them when gold loses its value, and the only thing you have at the end of the day is the love of your family and the spouse at your side? I do not care who you are, or how many buildings have your name on them.  When you traumatize children by separating them from their families indefinitely, locking them in places to be hurt, abused,  and yes, in one instance, die alone in his own vomit , to me you are the poorest of poor, and in no way in this life or the next a success.  When you value a digital sign with arrows and numbers over the 22 lives that have been lost(I'm quite sure that's more at this point), and the more that will surely come, you are less than a man. I don't care who you are,  or what you do.  If these are your actions, shame on you.  Shame on your family,  shame on your legacy,  shame on your heritage, and shame that you only have a black hole where you should have had a heart.",Liberal,1583892485,ravenmarie666,65,1,True,2020-03-10

Thinking of leaving my party,"
I have been a lifelong republican (donated to Bush and Trump and you can check my post history) a few months ago I lost my job and got behind on some bills and had to live off credit cards but continued to pay the minimums because my credit has always been important to me and I knew I would want to buy a house in the near future. I now have a great job but need around 3k payed down to get approved for a home for my wife and children. I owe around 5k for ALL my debt and can‚Äôt get a loan for the 3k because it will run my credit and having a fresh account will drop my score and mess up my debt to income ratio. I started a go fund me to help pay my debt off (yes it‚Äôs my debt and I shouldn‚Äôt ask for help and I NEVER EVER HAVE) but I figured there would be some kind people to help me as I‚Äôve always helped others. I posted it on a few pages I frequent and I received all kinds of backlash, being called lazy, a bum, told to get another job etc. I‚Äôve never been so disappointed in my party. My mind is blown as I figured I had a lot of the same thoughts as other Republicans. I have always helped others and my dream has always been to have a home for my family. I will probably leave the party after this, I‚Äôve never been treated this way. If this is how the republicans treat people in their party who need a little help I want no part of it.

It is pretty clear now more than ever Healthcare has to be key issue that needs to be addressed,"So many other countries are testing more people in a day than we have so far. I think I remember Tapper saying they are doing 10k a day in South Korea  some of those test coming via a drive thru.testing stations. 

Our current testing rate is no where near there.

The fact that insurance companies want to look like saints cause they waived off Coronavirus testing is still fucked up. 

According to this [article](https://www.kens5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-testing-could-cost-up-to-2400-in-bexar-county/273-95786299-688e-40f5-87e0-5f6e513605e8) in San Antonio without insurance it could cost you $2400 just for the test. Let alone if you end up having it and need to be quarantined or worse need extra hospital care. 

What's worse about private insurance only in the US is those who aren't insured and their reluctance to go to hospital due to how much it costs. [article ](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/10/coronavirus-texas-poses-challenges-people-without-insurance/)

The people who can't afford insurance likely can't afford to miss work. 

Universal Healthcare should be a key point that needs to be pushed in the presidential debates and the VP debates. 

I'm not saying private insurance needs to be abolished. But there should be some national insurance that covers everyone.

"Hello fellow liberals, I can explain why the corona virus isn't a purely authentic global epidemic."," You've all seen the the claim that ""every election year has a disease""

SARS 2004, AVIAN 2008, SWINE 2010, MERS 2012, EBOLA 2014, ZIKA 2016, EBOLA 2018, CORONA 2020

Well,  why does the corona virus go beyond and transcend into a global  epidemic in the news? I'm not here to dispute scientific concenses that  viruses can grow and infect people eponentially if not contained, but  that is not specific to just the corona virus. It happens with all  viruses. You're sixth sense tells you that something is not making  sense, how is the corona virus more special? Its not. You're suspicion  that the news is drumming up the virus is also correct, but why?

Let  me tell you exactly what is happening. Before the virus became front  page news there where indicators that the US economy was showing signs  of an incoming recession or depression, which in turn would effect the  world economy. Rather than the headlines reading ""Global recession  caused by x,y,z"" x,y,z referring to the political, economic, and social  policies as the causes of this recession, the scapegoat headline is  ""Global recession caused by the corona virus."" It masks the underlying  cause of the recession. The establishment doesn't want you questioning  the actual political, economic and social policies that are causing this  recession because it would lead to public outcry, demonstrations,  riots, etc WHICH WOULD LEAD TO MAJOR political, economic, and social  policy changes, echoing the 2008 financial crisis.

Anyone else believe that Trump suddenly put on his big boy pants?,"I'm sorry, and maybe I'm just a really bitter soul after the 3 years of absolute BULLSHIT this administration has put us through,  the dishonesty,  the blackmailing of Ukraine,  the vengeance taken on all the witnesses who testified against the crook in the White House, and the barrage afterwards of all his Republican cronies who then ran to the news outlets to gloat in our faces, smugly claiming ""oh they just needed to restructure the workforce, it wasn't REALLY revenge"", but I feel my blood boiling even when I watch my favorite news outlet where after the ONE news conference yesterday, where Trump stood up and claimed that on a scale of 1 to 10, he gave his response to the coronavirus a TEN,  after this one little span of say 20 minutes, everyone is crooning  ""Oh look at the president! He's changed his tone!  He's realized how serious this is!  GASP! He's becoming a leader!!!!!!"" 

I'm literally sitting here on my couch screaming at my TV, SHAKING with anger,  ""He's not changed a damn thing!  He's a malignant narcissist,  and a sociopath, and they live off mimicking the emotions that match the moment!"" Why do you think so many people were infuriated at the hot mike moment after that whole Oval Office Address where he held his serious and ""presidential""demeanor until someone said ""okay you're good"". All appearance of seriousness literally melted away,  his face took on that constant almost flippantly snide expression that he supports perpetually,  and he slapped both his hands down in the desk and in a totally lighthearted tone said, ""Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!"" As though to say,  well that's out of the way, back to the golf course! So while I understand that we need leadership in this moment, I'll look to Pelosi, Schumer ,Dr. Fauci, and those people who who have consistently told their truth from day one. But these newscasters who sit there and ooze over Trump carrying on a news conference in a somewhat, kind of serious manner, much the same way I did with my toddler when by straight fluke she just happened to be standing over the training potty at just the right time to do her business, and yet by no stretch of the imagination did i even hope to think she was potty trained, I cannot even feel one iota of enthusiasm for anyone in this administration, because what Adam Schiff said still remains if not as true, even truer now when he asked the Senate why it was so important that they remove Trump from office in that moment instead of waiting for the coming election. ""You Cannot wait for the election because you cannot trust this president to do what is right for the people of this country and you know that this is true!"" And again, i point to the proof that Trump has already tried to poach the vaccine by buying the German lab that is closest to having one created.  Call me a bad American,  but I'll rally behind my fellow Americans, but I'll never, EVER support this man who has repeatedly pulled the rug out from under every one of us so many times now we have lost freaking count.  And before someone calls me unpatriotic,  it has nothing to do with patriotism.

Fighting the metaphorical virus (hysteria) will help defeat the literal one.,"The fight that's getting all the attention is the one most of us have little control over, beyond a few basic preventative steps, but the one with the greater potential for long-term damage is something each of us can fight: Irrational fear...and its deformed child, blind obedience.

Trust in the views of people dedicated to science rather than those in politics, and be aware of the context of media coverage: They collaborate with ruthless political elements to compete for your fear, **not your understanding**.  

Defeating a virus is a matter of time.  Defeating the sort of people who would exploit a virus to demolish democratic institutions and human rights is a matter of attention, intelligence, and will.  

The former is moot if the latter is ignored, because **freedom is the immune system of civilization.**  Take care you are not terrorized by talk of ""unseen enemies"" into surrendering yourself to ones in plain sight.  

While we restrict ourselves as a matter of common sense for the moment, stay aware of your own agency in that choice.   In the (inevitable) event that malicious people ignore science and abuse health powers to attack our lives and societies, keep it in your back pocket that it will be up to you to refuse when that day comes.

Given who is in control, there is almost no chance that these extraordinary powers will be surrendered willingly, so don't delude yourself that there will be any voluntary return to normality.  And more importantly, don't count on the media or cowardly politicians to tell you when the day to exercise your own judgment has arrived.

Why as a Progressive Democrat I don't think Biden is Hillary 2.0 and can potentially win in November,"So I'll be honest, during the primaries I will vote for Bernie Sanders even tho it's pretty clear Biden will win nomination. 

Now I know my a lot of other progressives like Kyle Kulinsky and Jimmy Dore view this election as a lost cause since they view Biden as Hillary 2.0. heck even some of non-political friends think Biden is Hillary 2.0 and won't win election. 

They often state how Trump will destroy Biden in the debates and for whatever reason claim his mind is deteriorating pointing to his word fumbles. As far as Biden sounding strange [here is an LA times article about verbal audibles that stutters use](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-03-19/joe-biden-stutter-speech)

As far as the debates are concerned I feel like everyone forgot how Trump did in the presidential debates himself back in 2016. The guy was nuts. Even during debates where he sounded sane to start it only lasted like 5 minutes before he went completely off the rails. They also seen to forget how Joe Biden did against Paul Ryan back in 2012.  

So I don't think he'll perform as poorly as people think he will. 

Back in the 2016 primaries the states typically labelled as the Blue wall and I'm going to focus on Midwest states.

Wisconsin Bernie won 57% 

Michigan Bernie barely won with 49.68

Illinois Hillary won 50.56% it was close Bernie got 48.61%

I mention those states cause in general election.  Trump won Michigan and Wisconsin. 

In 2020 Democratic Primaries. 

In Michigan Biden won 50% to Bernie's 34%

In Illinois Biden crushed at 59% to Bernie's  36%

According to 538 based on polls in Wisconsin Biden is set to win big again. 

Plus President Trump has made several missteps during his presidency. 

Declaring he is a nationalist: [here](https://youtu.be/sazitj4x6YI) 

As relates to current events: [this was something Trump did literally when he first got into office ](https://youtu.be/8wTCknfXJGs)

President Obama installed a Pandemic team for this very situation. Could that have stopped or radically contained what's happening now. I can't really say cause College Frat crowd like those in Hawaii and Florida are gonna be dumb and reckless but it may have alerted them to get more tests. 

Trump's action during this pandemic has been slow and awful and very inefficient. And now we are facing a recession and a possible potential depression (I'm not really sure if we will fall that much) 

And as far as Allan Lichtmans 13 keys I have 5 keys flipped against Trump. And Lichtmans says if it is 6 keys then the challenger. Wins. Depending on how next few weeks goes I may get 6.

End Statement:

The states a lot of key states that Hillary to Bernie in primaries then in general to Trump Biden has won most of them with some very handily.

Those states just don't view Biden as Hillary 2.0.

As far as debates I think Biden will do well against Trump. 

Trump's ignorance towards science is hurting the economy and people's lives

What do make of the fact Trump has unequivocally improved healthcare and the lives of Americans?,"https://nypost.com/2019/09/21/five-smart-ways-trump-has-improved-our-health-care-system/

https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2019/02/13/president_trumps_health_care_actions_are_improving_the_lives_of_americans.html

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2019/06/17/529589.htm

https://www.breitbart.com/health/2019/03/28/president-trump-achievements-on-health-care-more-choice-lower-prices-life-saving-drugs/

Here are the top ten.

1.    Lower premiums. After the Obama administration oversaw massive double- and triple-digit annual increases in the price of Obamacare, the Trump administration has succeeded in stabilizing prices, which have decreased for many plans ‚Äî contrary to what many experts predicted. Obamacare is still too expensive, and its deductibles far too high, but Trump fulfilled his campaign promise in 2016 to stop the massive premium increases under the policy.

2.    Short-term plans. Obamacare eliminated many cheap, bare-bones, short-term health insurance plans favored by younger people, forcing them to pay huge premiums for coverage they did not need. Some of these plans are 80% cheaper than the cheapest Obamacare plan. President Trump signed an executive order, and promulgated new rules, that expand the length of these plans from three to 12 months, and allow them to be renewed for up to three years.

 3.   End to individual mandate. President Trump‚Äôs tax cut, signed into law in 2017, eliminated the requirement to purchase insurance ‚Äî the most constitutionally objectionable part of Obamacare. That change saved individuals and families hundreds of dollars per year in IRS fines. And contrary to the predictions of critics, it did not result in the collapse of the system as a whole, as premiums dropped and more insurance providers participated in the system.

4.    Group health plans across state lines. President Trump took a crucial step toward fulfilling the Republican promise of allowing people to buy insurance across state lines by signing an executive order in October 2017 that opened the door to employers in the same industry to pool their employees into common Associated Health Plans (AHPs) in different states. The result would be cheaper and better coverage for workers within those industries.

5.    Choice for veterans. President Trump signed the VA MISSION Act in 2018, which passed with bipartisan support and expanded options for veterans to obtain health care in the private sector. Trump has also prioritized addressing backlogs within the Veterans Affairs system. His commitment to veterans and first responders is such that even left-wing comedian Jon Stewart acknowledged Trump was doing a good job for 9/11 responders.

6.    ‚ÄúRight to try.‚Äù In May 2018, President Trump signed the ‚ÄúRight to Try‚Äù Act, which allows patients in desperate need to try new, experimental drugs that had not yet been approved by regulators. The law allowed patients to approach manufacturers directly, and limited their liability in the event the drugs did not work as hoped. In addition, the administration focusing on streamlining new drug approvals at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

 7.   Drug price information. President Trump has presided over the largest decline in drug prices in 46 years, and is proposing measures to lower them even further. In his 2019 State of the Union address, for example, he proposed ‚Äúrequir[ing] drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.‚Äù He also proposed eliminating kickbacks to the middlemen in the prescription drug industry.

8.    Opioids and fentanyl. The Obama administration failed to deal with the opioid epidemic, even declining to declare a national emergency to stop the proliferation of deadly fentanyl. In contrast, President Trump has made the fight against opioids and fentanyl a priority. His effort to build a barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, and his administration‚Äôs tougher border enforcement, have also aimed to improve public health by stopping the drug flow.

 9.   Better administration. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday that his administration is doing a better job of administering Obamacare than the Obama administration itself. One way it is doing so is through allowing the states greater flexibility in addressing their insurance markets ‚Äù rather than subscribing to the previous administration‚Äôs prescriptive one-size-fits-all approach,‚Äù wrote Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verna.

 10.   Support for repeal. President Trump‚Äôs enduring commitment to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a policy that actually works is crucial. The alternative is letting the government take over health care entirely, which Democrats are embracing in the ‚ÄúMedicare for All‚Äù policy ‚Äî which would ban private insurance and limit access to experimental drugs, among other fatal flaws. If not for Trump, Republicans would have given up long ago.",Liberal,1584890949,darksouls614,1,1,True,2020-03-22

The misreported nature of the new coronavirus vs the cost of lives in economic depressions.,"How much are we over-correcting for China and Italy's misinformation/underestimation of the risks of the coronavirus, with our own misinformation, and underestimation of the deaths from economic depression?

Only \~10% of the ""*deaths with coronavirus""* in Italy are actually ""*deaths from coronavirus*"" - due to the atypical way Italy reports information on those that die, yet the Italian National Health Institute keeps trying to stop the widespread misreporting (almost all media, and stats websites/maps are incorrectly reporting *all* of these deaths as ""*death from coronavirus*"") and no-one is listening in the panic - as some of their ICU's are clearly overburdened, along with fear of a making an underestimation as happened in Wuhan (with total misinformation campaign), and happened in Italy, who did not realise the threat specific to their population and health system.

The expected death rate in Italy per day is \~1,600 at this time of year, and only those that die are guaranteed to be tested (it is or will soon be the case that a *majority* of people in northern Italy either have or will have had the coronavirus, the majority of those are symptom free, almost none are tested), and unsurprisingly, many of the deceased had coronavirus. Only \~10% of Italy's daily deceased-test-positive for coronavirus actually died in an ICU, the rest were mostly part of Italy's expected daily deaths, 99% of the ""*deaths with coronavirus*"" had *at least* one chronic disease, but happened to have coronavirus when they died.

Europe's most overburdened ICUs were always going to be those in northern Italy at this time because:

* They have an increasingly ageing population, now the 2nd oldest population in the world
* Northern Italy has by far the worst air pollution in Europe, causing dangerous smog
* They've had low deaths in previous years in the cold/flu season (can be up to e.g. 60,000 people a year in e.g. the UK), increasing the pool of old and chronically ill people that might be expected to die this year.

Some Herpesviruses are carried by over 90% of the population worldwide - if everyone who died in northern Italy on a daily basis was tested for ""herpes"", and declared to have ""died with herpesvirus"", but then widely reported as ""died from herpesvirus"" - while some \~48 % of these people had been symptom free of herpes their entire lives.. We'd have hundreds of ""herpes symptom free ... deaths from herpesvirus"" being reported, which is ludicrous. Well, we now have likely hundreds of ""coronavirus symptom free ... deaths from coronavirus"" being reported/misrepresented - which is batshit crazy - and sending the whole world into panic. Don't believe me? The average age of those dying in northern Italy *with coronavirus* is 81. Again, 90% of these deaths are not happening in ICU's. 48% of 80-89 year-olds with coronavirus on the Diamond Princess were *symptom free*, probably a very similar number to the many of the mystery 90% ""*deaths with coronavirus""* in Italy, reported as ""*deaths from coronavirus*"", that do not have coronavirus/COVID-19 as a cause of death on their death certificate at all, dying outside of their otherwise overburdened ICUs, of whom almost all, over 99% have *at least* one major chronic disease, in their 70s, 80s and 90s.

Excess mortality has not significantly increased in any country in the world, yet people are claiming an apocalyptic/dramatic fatality rate of 5% coming out of Italy based on this widespread misreporting. The Diamond Princess (worse case with many old aged people) has about 0.6% and Germany, with now \~40,000 cases - below 0.6%, at about 0.55%. The Swiss government claimed that the situation in southern Switzerland (next to Italy) is ""dramatic‚Äú, yet local doctors say everything is normal.

Especially check out the recent daily updates from this Swiss doctor:

[https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19/](https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19/)

Yes it's potentially dangerous to some people, and every death from coronavirus is tragic - they are happening, and some health systems are struggling with the demand of looking after so many of our frail, many of whom will have to risk the coronavirus, and where it happens it should be reported on accurately - but there will be no front line from which to report economic collapse, these people will suffer in silence. Committing suicide to avoid homelessness, mental health issues from the lack of opportunity, or the stress of uncertainty. These issues are potentially colossal, and being downplayed/ignored, while the risk from coronavirus is being pornographed to the world.

Having a virus that can overburden your heath system should not mean that it is then OK to wholesale misreport vast numbers of deaths to get support for that health system. We should be able to deal with overloaded ICUs just as well with the true risk being stated, as with a vastly over-sensationalised risk to the public like we have now. Without realising it, society has begun a negotiation between:

* ICU workers, the frail, and the sensationalist media who can profit from their heroism, dramatic scenes, and overstated deaths
* those at the bottom of the economic ladder, their dependants, and those that we may now push there, who get screwed in economic collapses, suffer/die miserably out of sight, out of the sensationalist media well before their time, with no palliative care, other than their self medication.

If we get this - whole - calculation wrong, based on misrepresentations of the truth, rather than the actual truth, this will lead to more deaths than necessary - *as happened in Wuhan* \- where initially only the economic case for ""just carrying on"" prevailed in the misrepresentation of *that* evidence - when Wuhan could easily have afforded some downtime to sort out the virus - that *would* have maximised their public health, before they fixed their misrepresentation of the risk.

When only one side of this colossal negotiation is being heard, hyped in the media, or not heard at all, we are almost certainly making a bad situation worse.

Health systems are - and will - be overburdened by this. Even this happens from time to time outside of pandemics, and medical workers are probably fed up with no-one caring when it does happen, or when they are overworked. But should we flood the news with misleading stats giving a significant risk of a truly damaging overreaction? An overreaction that will now very likely mean we make a miscalculation, and lead to worse health effects for healthy, working age adults, from economic depression - which has no front line at all from which to report from?

The UK actually had a sensible ""herd immunity"" path, (which in practice it still has, but doesn't want to publicly admit as only the most panicked were being heard - it's now in the flatten the curve part of the herd immunity path truth be told) which, believe me, will be the path the USA will eventually find itself in, where the only thing stopping more transmission will be that most people have immunity - and was the only path available to any significantly globalised country - it's just a matter of how soon/hard to flatten, and how much damage to society is done in the economic downturn vs the damage to society from overloaded ICUs - the only thing currently being hyped up or mentioned almost at all. Societies like the UK and USA are so porous to other countries populations under globalisation that a border clampdown and aggressive testing, while keeping the economy going would never work like it did in South Korea, and seemingly Japan - these could blow up at any time too if their testing falls behind their outbreaks. Any globalised country with no access to anything less than regular, most-of-population testing that does not have herd immunity, will keep having to have lockdowns untill herd immunity is eventually present. But when the only voice being heard are the cries of ICU workers, misrepresentations of the deaths, or the odd healthy young person who dies suddenly in unexplained circumstances and happened to test positive from coronavirus, which happens outside pandemics too - when a majority in many countries now have it.... the a far more muted voice of those struggling with economic collapse may prove a much more costly voice to ignore (lessons from Wuhan) for public health, and the fabric of society.

A professor of risk at Bristol University in the UK has estimated that a 6.4% fall in GDP in the UK will cost 400,000 lives - the number currently expected to be saved from coronavirus due to the lockdown, guided by figures like that of Italy. Any higher a cost to GDP - may cost more lives than we save. I hope these lives we are paying for in the economic depression are worth it.

Are there any liberal pro Israel groups?,"The older generation of liberals have more common sense when it comes to Israel. They understand that it was the Arabs that attacked first, slaughtering innocent woman and children throughout the early 1900‚Äôs. When the Israelis and the Palestinian Arabs were given their separate land in 1947 the Arabs refused and, along with a coalition of surrounding Arab countries, attacked Israel with the intent in destroying it. They lost that war and lost some of the land they had used to attack Israel. Still, Israel gave the Sinai back to Egypt, to keep the peace. Seems fair right? 
They tried again a year later, and lost. They tried again in 1967, using the tall hills of Judea and Samaria to bombard Israeli settlements. They had Israel out manned and out gunned, but not out smarted. Despite what the whole world bet would be Israel‚Äôs destruction, Israel pushed the Arab coalition back, forcing them to surrender, within 6 days. 
They made it all the way to Cairo in the West, Damascus in the north, and completely taking over Judea and Samaria. Over the next few decades Israel would wind up giving up 91% of the land they had gained for peace, even as large Palestinian Arab terrorist groups, calling for Israel‚Äôs destruction, committed horrific acts in of violence against innocent Israeli citizens. 
Arab leaders around the world still blatantly say they want to destroy Israel. If Israel had given back all of Judea and Samaria, they certainly would have been destroyed by now, given the kinds of weaponry available today. 
And now, after all the atrocities that have befallen them, they are now being smeared as ‚Äúan apartheid state‚Äù or are ‚Äúcommitting genocide‚Äù. This is all lies, stemming from a conspiracy of Arab leaders to spread disinformation to the west. The goal being a fully autonomous Arab Palestinian state controlling all of the West Bank, leaving Israel to their mercy. 
I already know the very title of this post is going to piss a lot of people off. And I‚Äôm going to get a lot of angry comments, but I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm as left as it gets and I believe supporting Israel and supporting Zionism is apart of that.

‚Äî Zionism (in the context of modern Jews) stems from a movement in the late 1890s-early 1900‚Äôs among Jewish leaders (see Theodore Herzl)  to establish a nation all Jewish people could retreat to for safety. This was a time when anti-semitism was on the rise and Jews were being massacred in Russia. 
Some of these Zionist leaders were in favor establishing Israel somewhere in Africa, or perhaps in the Americas. More were in favor of returning to their ancestral homeland.
There is nothing in any Zionist movement calling for an expansion of Israel. It is simply a movement to have a place where the Jewish people can go for safety. No more holocausts. 

‚ÄúIsrael is an apartheid state‚Äù
‚Äî Israel is the most diverse liberal democracy in the Middle East. They grant citizenship and voting rights to all people living within their border. Almost half the country is Arab, and they enjoy more rights than Arabs in Arab countries. The ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù and Gaza Strip Arabs have decided to forego those rights and be a nation apart from Israel. They have their own STATE called PALESTINE. Unlike Israel, Palestine IS an apartheid state. In Israel there are at least a dozen Arabs that hold seats in the Israeli government. Care to guess how many Jews are in the Palestinian government? 

‚ÄúIsrael is committing mass genocide‚Äù
‚Äî this is an even more ignorant statement than the previous. There is literally no proof of any genocide going on in Israel. Again though, take a look at the surrounding nations and maybe you‚Äôll find it curious why there are no more Jews. 

‚ÄúIsraeli soldiers kill innocent Palestinians‚Äù
‚Äî if somebody is threatening your life would just lie down your gun? The Palestinian injuries and deaths stem from those Palestinians attacking Israeli soldiers in large numbers. They throw rocks and roll burning tires at them. 
Israeli soldiers are commanded not to shoot at innocent civilians and to only shoot if their life is in danger. What would you do, if someone who wants to kill you and thinks your whole family and people should be massacred, were throwing big rocks at you, along with 50+ other people? 

‚ÄúNetanyahu is corrupt‚Äù 
‚Äî Even if he is, so what? Is America bad bc Donald trump is the president? 

‚ÄúThe Palestinians are suffering‚Äù 
The Palestinians are suffering because of their culture of hate against Jews, Israel, and the West. Their leadership suppresses them, killing off any opposing voices instead of oh idk, an election. 

In short, there really is no easy answer to this. The Jewish people lived there first, for about 1500 years until the Romans, and eventually Muslims kicked most of them out. Arabs then started settling the area, especially Jerusalem for the next thousand years however some Jewish communities would remain. 
Under the Arabs the land became desolate and barren, mostly populated by nomadic Bedouins and crumbling ancients towns. 
When the Jewish people were given back control over the land, they took pride in it and brought it back to life. Where there was only desert just a hundred years ago is now filled with forests and farms, magnificent cities and highways, and a bustling free people. 

These people are an enigma for the part of the world they live in. They‚Äôre a lot like you and me, but confined to country the size of New Jersey, surrounded by nations of millions who want to see them massacred. 
Still, they feel relatively safe, wake up in a bed and house similar to yours. In a neighborhood that could pass as an American suburb. Going to work or going to school. Paying bills and taxes. Having to wash the car once a week and remembering to pick up the dog shit every evening before it gets too dark. They vote. They can wear whatever clothes they want to wear regardless of gender. They‚Äôre allowed to be socialists or atheists or heck even practice witchcraft if they were so inclined. They can openly criticize their government and/or religion without government reprisal. They can form political parties and anyone can run for public office. 
These rights are not fully available to the citizens of any Arab state where in some, woman have their clitorises cut off, or atheist are burned at a stake, or women are stoned for wanting an education. These are not good people American liberals put so much support behind. They hold vile racist beliefs that aren‚Äôt just going to go away within a few generations. 

The Palestinian Arabs should feel free of any occupying force, but not at the expense of Israel‚Äôs existence.",Liberal,1578640000,friendofalladin,0,1,True,2020-01-10

What's Up With the CenterLeftPolitics Sub-Reddit?,"The CenterLeftPolitics sub-reddit folks appear to have permanently banned me for one comment on a post mildly defending unions and the right to strike.

Can someone fill me in on that sub-reddit's reputation and what in the world happened there (Educated guesses welcome)?

How is a sub-reddit that bans you over one comment defending a union center-*left*?  Sounds like a right-wing sub-reddit to me.  I'm not even sure I would have been banned for one post like that on a right-wing sub-reddit (Not that I belong to any- I'm just going on basic Internet etiquette from message forums and stuff- most people will drop you a line and tell you what they don't like and what they are looking for before permanently banning you).  Is there any criteria for sub-reddits to fit their title, or is it sort of a land grab situation where a user just starts one and can do whatever with it?

They even blocked me from messaging their mods to ask why I was banned over what I thought was one mainstream Democratic comment.  I don't even *know* it was that comment- they didn't say.  I assume it was that comment because it was my only recent comment there that I recall.

I'd like to make an appeal in advance for the mods *here* to let this discussion happen or at least drop me a line and tell me where I can I have it.  I want to hear from people and try to get some context.",Liberal,1578791742,CharmCityCrab,22,1,True,2020-01-11

Some philosophy behind the frustration of a right wing cult of my family relatives.," 

Hello everyone so today i wanted to rant about something and kind of get it of my chest because it has really been stressful for me. I really have been struggling with my xenophobic uncles, since they always been hateful towards minorities and different races/ ethnicities and my uncles in the past have been saying that they wanted to burn all Albanians but they also naivly use Hitler to call anybody who doesn't agree with them in other trivial issues like when someone is more opinionated than them etc, so i assume they kind of go with the flow of society not really having any groud or basis for their beliefs / academic education or knowledge on the topic of politics just overall hatred, even for the LGBT community they used to harass people that wouldn't fit to that narative of macho man and feminine girl that they would debate their intelligence compared to male, and i live in Greece so for Greeks population in general there is usually an antagonization towards Albanians Turkey and immigrants in general, so i've been trying to avoid them since it has been really annoying in the past talking with them and bullying me for not looking man enough, so anyway because i've been estranging them they do find a way to message me on social media and send me these videos of their dearest politicians that they are indoctrinated into from their religious culture etc. So i do understand them but my uncle this time posted a video of a politician talking about evidence they have that they're paying for immigrants.

So im going to denotation of the sittuation and what i see here happening.

Initially they did discover that ""we are paying for the immigrants"" and they are suddenly all traumatised by it , second they react like they did recently realize that we have immigrants and now they are terrorized or petrified that we are having immigrants. So therefore im assuming that this is the incentive they have to blame and going through their individual lifes and experiences they can associate this with every difficulty, complexity , labour , struggling etc. So these politicians do advocate and appeal to the commoner's nationalist sensitivity and fear of immigration since over the 50% of the country right now is right leaning and my uncles right now have been more and more drawn to populist conspiracy theorist social circle and friends so i think this is probably the right time to disassociate myself from them completely",Liberal,1578926658,pasdp0l43,6,1,True,2020-01-13

I‚Äôm 14 and Bernie is the only one that I feel I can trust with my future,"
Look, I know many will discount my opinion because of my age, and I understand that. However, this election will affect me more then anyone voting in it. 

Bernie is the only candidate with the conviction to stick to his guns and the understanding that compromise is needed to create real change. He is both the birth of a revolution and the man known for writing and passing an incredible amount of bills. He supported LGBT rights since it was radical, and he picket fenced the Vietnam war before pretending to condemn it was a sure way to gain polling numbers.

He will greatly improve quality of life of both the people entering and leaving our workforce, rather then the 1% that never needed to join it. I want to know that my college cannot send me into lifelong debt, my company cannot take away my right to healthcare, and if I am unlucky enough to get cancer I will not be forced into bankruptcy.

Not to mention the fact that even the high middle class will find that their wallets feel fuller.  Employers will not be able to hold healthcare over unions head, and the increase of taxes will be fractions of the current cost of healthcare. In addition, the cost of college and mission of relieving student debt will be payed for by Wall Street taxes, meaning that the only way it can affect you is the fact that your college funds will go from concerningly low to more then enough.

And to those who think M4A is unrealistic, it has been put into affect, it exists in 32 of 33 developed countries, and I bet you can guess who the one is.

"Question, am I oversimplifying this, or is Elizabeth Warren's Wealth Tax as Ludicrous as it seems?","So this is her website page describing her policy: [https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax)

I'll quote the pertinent paragraph:

&gt;That‚Äôs why we need a tax on wealth. The Ultra-Millionaire Tax taxes the wealth of the richest Americans. It applies only to households with a net worth of $50 million or more‚Äîroughly the wealthiest 75,000 households, or the top 0.1%. Households would pay an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 6% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion. Because wealth is so concentrated, **this small tax on roughly 75,000 households will bring in $3.75 trillion in revenue over a ten-year period.**

Alright, so in general, tax the ultra rich, spread it out to the poor and middle class - that's fine. However, when I get into the details of this plan, something just strikes me as absolutely nuts...

It is based off of net worth, and not income.

Now, this is really besides the point, but whatever net worth they've built up has already been taxed to some extent, either through capital gains or income tax. Just pointing that out as a principal; but it may very well be the case that tax havens and the like proves this wrong.

Anyway, to the main point: net worth doesn't mean someone is liquid. I'm just going to give an anecdote from my personal life to illustrate the problem I see with this. I met a friend in 4th grade. His father, around the 1990s, starting a water hydraulic manufacturing company. It started in earnest, and at present, makes about 22M a year in revenue. It's in a small town, provides for high skill labor jobs, such as CNC machinists, manufacturing line expediters, and mechanical engineers designing the products themselves. It's a nice piece of the community, creating opportunities for people who don't go to college, but want to learn a skill, with a reasonable payday, healthcare, and a 401k.

Now i'm not in finance (and please feel free to correct me if my following calculation is absurd) but given a rolling average of 18 - 22M in revenue of the last three years and less than 1M in debt, I'd say the company is worth about 45M if someone wanted to buy it outright. 

Well, obviously, the person that started this company decades ago has invested in rental homes to AirBnB out, bought an appreciating property for himself and his family to hang out at in the summers, etc. So he's right about on the fringe of the 50M threshold for Warren's bill. 

This guy is not liquid. He doesn't draw some million dollar salary from the company. He gives himself 100k - 200k based off of how the year went (there's been some bad years). This dude pretty much just leverages debt. He doesn't pay for these properties, he just uses a portion of the cash-flow of the business as collateral and makes mortgage payments.

Nevertheless, he is still technically around that 50M mark, but has very little liquidity to back him up. Elizabeth Warren's tax bill would essentially force him to divest and sell pieces of his company just to pay the taxes. You mite feel like ""well the guy lives a fine enough lifestyle,"" but if he were to do that, you no longer have a local running this business which has done so much good for the community. Who would buy the stake from him? Someone even richer? What are you going to end up with? Richer and richer people buying off the property of high net, low liquidity individuals - causing even more disparity and less localized priorities.

So, my question to everyone is this: am I somehow misinterpreting this, or is Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax really just going to lead to capital gains earning and million-dollar salary draining folk taking the property of business owners who pretty much embody a fair mid-market business owner persona? Is this not going to lead to less localized priorities for community businesses? Is this not going to simply create more wealth disparity? 

I know I gave an anecdote, but there are plenty of people who are worth 50M who aren't that liquid because they just own stuff, not siphon the liquid dollars for themselves.",Liberal,1579067940,amayle1,0,1,True,2020-01-15

Once they get Biden, Biden's son, or (I pray for this) Adam Schiff on the stand, they'll see that berating those people on the stand is actually detrimental to their true aim: to make it seem as though the Democrats are the true villains here. In addition to that, it would increase viewership a hundredfold if these people were on the stand.

Republicans need to be studied,"When this all blows over and the US is left a third world hellhole, people need to go back and study all the online derpes who laughed at the democrats concerns and fears that turned out to be right. If you are a trump supporting regressive party then you live in the ultimate echo chamber so you probably don't even know about the anti-choice rally. But you accuse others of being in an echo chamber. Because rule #1 in republican gaslighting is to accuse the other side of what they are doing. But as the recent anti-choice rally and impeachment prove, democrats and all who despise Trump have been right all along as they've been mocked by the usual keyboard psychopaths.

So this behavior needs to be studied by psychiatrists in the worlds leading universities which will not be in America when trump is done. I agree Trumpers, people are too stupid to learn from their mistakes in 4 years, especially when they aren't forced to deal with the consequences of their actions like adults. No one is being delusional except you. We are proven right every day by this guy, you are proven wrong and look more and more out of touch and in deep egotistical denial.

So I‚Äôm just one of 1 million other voices but I‚Äôm hoping enough of you read this‚Äîmaybe someone that is a position to make a difference?

We clearly lost the last election to trump even though very few people were expecting that to happen.

I think one of the major problems was the fact that Hillary Clinton has little to no charisma, she‚Äôs more of the same, and didn‚Äôt inspire people to get out to the polls.

Now there‚Äôs clearly been a huge pushback from the Obama terms‚ÄîThose leaning right really didnt like any of it, and it should‚Äôve been obvious that there was going to be a big turnaround (perceived, not justified) after Obama‚Äôs second term was over.

But what concerns me most is the Democrats are still playing by the same book as they were four years ago‚Äî

None of the candidates are really all that inspiring and Sanders who should have gotten the nomination the last time around was cheated out of the nomination.

It seems to me like the only other candidate who might make some effectual changes Tulsi‚Äîbut that‚Äôs an even longer shot.

The Republicans are clearly playing scorched earth tactics, and the Democrats in power clearly haven‚Äôt got the memo‚ÄîWe‚Äôre going to end up in an even worse position if this continues.

It might feel a little bit grainy but I think we need to dig deep, And fight them the same way they‚Äôve been fighting us

I don‚Äôt mean to imply that the ends always justify the means but clearly we‚Äôve seen what can happen if you let people use these incredibly dirty (but HIGHLY effective tactics) to further agendas that are objectively worse and worse for us

Even 15 years ago any mention of potential Russian involvement would‚Äôve been a death sentence to any politicians career. It‚Äôs clearly obvious that Trump was not smart enough to be The mastermind of some Russian intelligence plan‚ÄîBut the fact that the Russians wanted him in power should be a red flag enough

I believe the old expression is ‚Äúthe enemy of my enemy is my friend‚Äù

Well, what about the friends of my enemy?

Everything from how we are governed, to social welfare programs, how we treat our citizens‚ÄîIt all matters so much. But the problem is the average person in their day-to-day life doesn‚Äôt think about those things. Even if they were this stuff is so utterly complicated it really takes a government to perform.

Not to be the paranoid prepper either, but the threat of nuclear war has not gone away. The USSR fell, But Russia has definitely come back in stride. 

It‚Äôs easy to forget these things while you‚Äôre playing on your iPhone but it‚Äôs not a stretch to say that in these matters the fate of the world is kind of in the balance.

It's not about Democrats voting. It's about everyone else.,"Power in politics is the only thing that matters.  Since the game is democracy, the power is in the middle.  That's not inspiring or nostalgic, progressive or fancy.  The game has always been slanted towards conservatism, because the left is not so monolithic in its thinking, therefore, not as organized.  Only with Trumps's election have democrats lost their smugness and started to wake up.  The mid-terms showed that we can take back power and woman and people of color can share in that power.  I think the world is moving toward a more progressive future.  Any one of the democratic candidate will be better than what we have, but only good ole stammering Joe can bring along independents and thinking patriotic republicans.  It's not exciting.

Defeating Trump in November: Phase One," 

How to Turn Out the Blue Vote in November, Phase One. I've been trying to share this on as many lib sites as I can.¬† We can write all the postcards and send all the texts we want... but nothing is going to beat an honest conversation with someone you trust when it comes to getting out the vote.   


We can't have another four years of this guy in office... please share on as many lib sites/boards/subreddits/etc as you can.¬† Phase Two coming soon!

Anyways, here's what to do:

***Find out which of your friends is not a voter; I‚Äôve been doing this by a simple, ‚Äúfriends of mine who don‚Äôt vote, why are you abstaining?‚Äù Be direct, but reasonable‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt post about how Trump is sending us towards authoritarianism and one-party rule, even though he clearly is. ¬†Once you get a few answers, send them a private message (or talk in real life‚Ä¶ you can still do that!) respecting their outlook, but politely ask them to reconsider, voting blue of course.***¬†

***To the ones that are receptive to this, send them to this link:*** [***https://votesaveamerica.com/***](https://votesaveamerica.com/) ¬†***It‚Äôs the best one-stop shopping I‚Äôve found so far to register to vote, find your polling place, and find out about the Democratic candidates so far. ¬†Check out the site yourself, and help walk them through if needed.***¬†

¬†***Add incentives to election day and celebrate! ¬†Offer to drive to your local polling place together. ¬†Go out for bowling, billiards, and/or booze afterwards (first round is on you)! ¬†Do whatever you can to get your like-minded pals to turn the vote out this November and VOTE BLUE.***¬†

***Imagine‚Ä¶ if each one of us simply got two of our friends to vote blue in this upcoming election, our victory would be so crushing, so overwhelming that no amount of election interference or MAGA poll intimidation could deny our victory. ¬†We can do this folks‚Ä¶ but not if we don‚Äôt mobilize now. We can‚Äôt stand idly by and hope things get better‚Ä¶ we must make the change. ¬†Let‚Äôs make it happen.***¬†",Liberal,1581003959,KyussSun,0,1,True,2020-02-06

Someone tweets a pic of Jonathan Pie taking a selfie with far right showing how much the far right like him for caricaturing liberals. Pie‚Äôs writers use tweet to make a video caricaturing liberals.,"Jonathan Pie videos frequently contain attacks on liberals and feminists. As academics have pointed out, the recent rise in the far right has been driven by propaganda demonising the left and feminists.  So unsurprisingly the far right like him even though Pie is left wing and he sometimes attacks them too. The fact someone on the left says it makes their propaganda much stronger. 

However his writers, one of whom is Andrew Doyle, strenuously deny that the far right like their stuff and laugh about how absurd it is when anyone points it out and says they are helping liberals by teaching them how bad they are. So this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Influxpress/status/1071768928496599040) with the far right wanting selfies with Pie is really quite damning.

Doyle and Walker‚Äôs response is to create a lavish video using the witch hunt narrative about Pie's careers being ruined by the tweet.

Iowa Caucus Discrepancy Analysis,"# Introduction

Been busy this weekend trying to make sense of all these reports of discrepancies in the results of the Iowa Caucus. I just finished double checking my models, and wanted to share it.

To start, quick introduction.

I am an engineer. I don't have a political science background, but I am a Data Scientist at NASA. You may also know me as the person behind the [Medicare for All Calculator](http://sandershealthcare2020.com)

# The Caucus Model

My challenge was this: Build a model that can take the Final counts per candidate, and calculate all discrepancies between the reported SDEs and what would be expected to be the actual SDEs.

Model (in Excel spreadsheet form): https://1drv.ms/x/s!Am_fv_2JmQAAgZh2QJJf1v9c30kNIw?e=MAOpIH

For those that want to play with it: Download it and look at each precinct on the Scenario tab.

I am working on making sure this can get in the right hands at the Iowa Democratic Party, and the relevant Campaigns, so if you know the contact that I need to reach out to, send me a private message.

# Model Details

## Assumptions:

1. Viability threshold is 0.25 for 2 delegates, 0.1666667 for 3 delegates, and 0.15 for 4+ delegates. That is multiplied by the total in Final Expression and rounded up.
2. Cannot perform an adjustment that causes a candidate to lose their only delegate, unless all other candidates only have 1 delegate.
3. When performing adjustment, if excess, you must remove delegate from candidate that was rounded up the most
4. When performing adjustment, if short, you must add delegate to candidate that was rounded down the most

## Unresolvable Model Parameter:

1. In ~15 cases that an adjustment is performed wrong, or an unviable candidate is given delegates, there can be coin flips that would needed to have been performed that the model doesn't resolve.

# Results

1. The model calculates the exact same result for 1667 of 1765 scenarios
2. The model detected 139 coin flips
3. 98 Precincts had discrepancies:
4. 51 of those were due to ""Incorrect candidate chosen during adjustment
5. 21 of those were due to ""Unviable candidate given delegates""
6. 14 of those were due to ""Incorrect rounding of candidates

In the end, these errors accounted for **Pete Buttigieg getting +2.10 extra SDEs, and Bernie Sanders being shorted -4.44 SDEs**. All other candidates were generally only +/- 1 SDE.

**Sanders wins Iowa Caucus by: 5.03 (0.23%) SDEs**


## The 18 most significant precinct errors impacting the 2 leaders were:

These account for 6.09 of the SDE error, the remaining errors roughly average each other out.

County | Precinct | Anomaly | Net Difference
---|---|----|----
Johnson | IOWA CITY 20 | Incorrect Rounding of Candidates | +0.81 SDEs for Buttigieg

Counterpoints to the whole ‚ÄúDemocrats are just as bad as Republicans‚Äù argument?,"So I was in a civil discussion with my dad about politics this weekend, discussing impeachment and the state of the Republican Party. My dad has always been a conservative Republican, although he has softened his viewpoints around some certain social issues in the past couple of years, I like to think because of some of my convincing and also the fact that I‚Äôm gay and he‚Äôs had to deal with that if he wants me in his life. Anyways, we like to talk about politics a lot. He doesn‚Äôt like Donald Trump personally and thinks Trump is an idiot, but when I‚Äôm trying to convince him for the sake of the country and my future to vote Trump out, he always resorts to muddying the waters and what I view as a false equivalency argument of a general ‚ÄúDemocrats are just as bad as Republicans‚Äù. It‚Äôs an argument that drives me nuts because no matter what I say, he‚Äôs always pointing out incidences of malfeasance by Democrats as a counterargument, true or not, potentially changing the subject, and not focusing on the issue we are discussing at hand. 

For example, when discussing Trump‚Äôs impeachment, he tries to turn the discussion to Biden or to Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachment as a counterpoint, instead of focusing on Trump‚Äôs actions and whether they‚Äôre right or wrong. I know this is a pretty common tactic, but I‚Äôm wondering if any of you have had success convincing family members to change their mind/vote on Trump, and what tactics you used to do so. I feel like I‚Äôm making headway with my father and since I know he doesn‚Äôt like Trump, I‚Äôm trying to figure out ways I can push him over the edge to change his mind.

Tl;dr Any suggestions for changing a family member‚Äôs mind on Trump who might be persuadable and good counterarguments to ‚ÄúDemocrats are just as bad as Republicans‚Äù?",Liberal,1581361382,alcarcalimo1950,24,1,True,2020-02-10

What are your thoughts on the theory that low-income Americans have been negatively and disproportionately affected by the rise of social liberalism?,"The decline in religiosity, and the concomitant collapse of church and other social institutions have undermined precisely the same people who have been hit hard by the economy.  Charles Murray pointed out this phenomenon in his book ""Coming Apart"" nearly a decade ago: America has bifurcated between more highly educated, higher-income Americans (Murray labels them residents of Belmont) and less educated, lower-income Americans (Murray labels them residents of Fishtown).  This holds true regardless of race. And contrary to popular opinion, those who are less educated and lower-income, particularly in the white community ‚Äî the base of support for President Donald Trump ‚Äî have been disproportionately affected by the excesses of social liberalism. Between 1960 and 2010, the marital rate among  highly educated, higher-income Americans ages 30 to 49 declined from 94% to 84%; the marital rate among Fishtown whites declined from 84% to 48%. Similarly, single motherhood increased from 1% of Belmont white college-educated women in 1970 to less than 6% in 2008; for Fishtown women, that number skyrocketed from 6% to 44%.   


 Most tellingly, secularism increased for both groups but far less among Fishtown residents (from about 29% in 1972-1976 surveys to 40% in 2006-2010 surveys) than Belmont residents (from 38% to 59%). In other words, the wages of social liberalism take a deeper toll on those who require more from social institutions, both economically and culturally. Denizens of The New York Times are far less likely to have children out of wedlock than the supposed religious fanatics they oppose ‚Äî but they're also likely to push both governmental and social policy designed to promote single motherhood, for example. They don't pay the price of the policies they push.",Liberal,1581626750,GhettoNeddo,28,1,True,2020-02-13

How do you deal with so much hatred in USA? Is libertarianism going to be the winner in this long war?,"I am not from the USA but have been following the politics of the USA for the last 3 months. Sorry for so many questions, but I cannot sleep at night with so many doubts. Answer whatever you can. 

1. First, impeachment. HIC is investigating whether Trump has done anything wrong with Ukraine. But from what I am noticing, republican politicians and voters have been shouting ""Impeachment is a sham, you are not letting us do our work, do nothing democrats, etc."" If Trump gets acquitted in this impeachment process due to lack of evidence, he will get more popularity, (GOP knows he did something wrong, that is why they are blocking it), but why are voters supporting Trump still? Police have to do their investigations, even if the people think the accused didn't do the crime. Why do people believe it as an action by democrats to undo the 2016 election? 
2. I don't know exactly what ads are promoted during election campaigns. How much do the people believe about whatever is shared on facebook is correct? 
3. Stats show that the majority of the voters get their news from Fox news. Is it really true (public pulse)? If that is the case, it is the end of democracy. I don't think any president in recent times attacked 90% of the media, it was Hitler's time. It also reminds of churches burning scientific journals. Trump and GOP have actually convinced people that only Fox News is credible, isn't it? Is it a mob mentality or shouting the same thing again and again so that people actually believe the false is the truth? The republicans voters are not even listening to what democratic presidential candidates have to say. 
4. Do republicans fear everything? Fear of job losses, Fear of immigrants, fear of people (so stocking more guns make them feel safer) and so many. Conservative def. averse to change or innovation and holding traditional values. When the world is changing every second, how long will this stance of conservatism stand (50 years, 100 years)? Is it doomed to die one day?
5. What is the percentage of people who support republicans in ages (40+) and (40-)? I am noticing a pattern in republican voters regarding demographics, I just wanted to validate. 
6. Do you think republicans hate more people than democrats? Why? I have seen so many posts on twitter with the Squad (AOC etc) having caption Ji\*\*\*\*\* (you know the word). That is the most disgusting thing I have seen in my life.
7. MAJORITY of Republican politicians campaign on voters' hatred towards all others (Muslims, immigrants, democrats, Lock Her Up), while MAJORITY of Democrats campaign on healthcare, jobs, climate change, etc. Why? Are GOP giving what the audience wants, even if the ideologies of such voters are harmful to society? 
8. Finally, how do you accept the fact that half of the USA is so dumb and full of hatred? I believe twitter did more harm than good. Every DAMN body had to have an opinion to shout at someone.

Letters from the front lines in the war on Thanksgiving - [compose yours here],"My dearest Mary,

I'm writing to you from the front lines of the War on Thanksgiving.

I know you did not want me to enlist, Mary, but I felt it was my duty to my country. I am just a humble, red-blooded, white, Christian, All-American male and I'd rather die than say ""Happy Fourth Week of November"" to someone.

I don't want to scare you, but I can say it with great honesty: This is a fearsome war, Mary. Unlike the war on Christmas, where we would march to the beat of our beloved Christmas carols like ""Silent Night"" and ""We Three Kings"", we are unable to find Thanksgiving-themed songs that weren't composed by godless liberals. Not even the Arlo Guthrie classic, ""Alice's Restaurant"" would be hummed. As a result, we sadly march in silence.

The other day, we were greeted with fresh coffee and donuts from supporters of our cause. We later realized it was but a facade when our black ""coffee"" was actually Pumpkin Spice Latte's,  and the donuts were gluten-free and sweetened with natural cane sugar. My friend, Zebulon is experiencing PTSD as a result. Fairtrade coffee be damned, Mary. Is there no end to how low the food-terrorists will sink? I think not. 

Worry not, Mary. This righteous war will soon be over, and after the stroke of midnight on Black Friday. I will join you early in the morning, as we wait in line at the Big Box store, to take advantage of doorbuster deals. This is our great American way.

All of my love, Roll Tide

Republican Clown Doug Collins just spent 10 minutes lying his ass off in congress.,"So for the last 10 minutes, during the opening of today's impeachment hearing, Doug Collins flapped his gums while he falsely claimed that Democrats are ignoring facts, while plainly ignoring all facts of the case. Now he's running his mouth about pointless procedural bullshit that is irrelevant to the matters of the hearing. This group continually just whines and cries because they cannot stand the fact that they hitched their cart to a poisoned and toxic horse. Now the joke of a human Matt Gaetz begins shouting like the pathetic frat boy loudmouth he is. The whole strategy at this point, for republicans, is to disrupt, delay, interrupt, obfuscate, bloviate etc.

They ignore facts while saying Democrats are ignoring facts  
They make the whole thing into a shit show while claiming Democrats are creating a shit show  
They lie left and right while saying democrats are lying.  


They have no integrity and only possess the capability to project.

They claim the institution of congress is in great danger, while manifestly representing that very threat.

I think that workplaces requiring a doctors note is a sensible idea that‚Äôs shifted in practice,"What I mean is, It seems very sensible to require that an employee both prove they were sick and prove they‚Äôre well enough to work again without getting others sick. I can‚Äôt argue the logic that it‚Äôs better to have a healthy workforce and to be sure about it. However, given the cost of healthcare and the way that the doctors note is required to even come back in combined with the corporate nature of a lot of jobs now, It makes it seem less like a sensible practice to protect employee health and more like a deterrent for employees to call in sick in the first place. 

I may be overthinking it here, but it seems to me that my job would rather me come in so they can send me home for not feeling well, as opposed to have me call them and tell them that. 

Maybe I‚Äôm blowing this out of proportion, it seems to me that requiring doctor notes isn‚Äôt as helpful as it might seem.

My two cents on MS-13.,"I just saw a tweet from Trump about an MS13 raid in Staten Island, NY, and people are giving thanks to the president as if he was the person leading the raid, which is ridiculous to even think because it is literally just a gang raid. It doesn‚Äôt matter who holds the Oval Office, if there‚Äôs any dirt on gang members there will always be a task force chasing them down. Anyways, I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôve been caught. They are harmful to normal people and if not at least really menacing and intimidating, it‚Äôs safer that they don‚Äôt go running free.

But that‚Äôs not what this post is about. It‚Äôs about the whole ‚ÄúMS13 members are animals‚Äù belief that people seem to denounce the ‚Äúfar-left‚Äù for ‚Äúprotecting savages‚Äù. Well, we‚Äôre not protecting anybody actually,  these are just facts. People pretend as if gangbangers aren‚Äôt made of blood, bone, muscle and skin, they are human just like the rest of us, and the image of MS13 is the embodiment of what happens when you decide to create such a dogshit environment for immigrants. It‚Äôs simple, hard places breed hard men. Calling people animals and doing gang-raids isn‚Äôt gonna fix the issue.

I grew up right in the center of LA, where lots of Hondurans, Salvadorans, and Central Americans moved a long time ago. First I want to reinforce the argument that MS13 began in America. Since it obviously did, and I know this because I literally grew up like 10-minutes away (walking) from where the 1st Mara click started. And wanna know the funny part? People use MS13 as one of the main demonstrations of what happens when immigrants keep flooding the border, and this is particularly hilarious because MS barely even has any territory anymore in LA. Other gangs like Wanderers, Crazy Riders (you probably haven‚Äôt even heard of these), and 18st control the same if not more hoods than MS does. I‚Äôve seen more active tagging crews than MS13. 

Now I want to talk about the same thing that keeps being brought up over and over and over again in regards to MS. That their motto is ‚ÄúRape, Steal, Kill, and Control‚Äù. This is literally the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. This may have originated from MS, but it‚Äôs not even proven that it has. This motto probably spread from gangland style documentaries. The fact that people believe this BS is enough evidence to me that middle-class Republicans have no idea what it‚Äôs like in the hood, hell, they‚Äôve never even seen or had an altercation with any gang members and they‚Äôre over here talking like MS is a terrorist organization. 

Let me make this clear, MS isn‚Äôt even an organization, no gang is. Clicks of similar gangs aren‚Äôt connected, they may be friendly, but by no means would a gang member claim to be from two sets. It just doesn‚Äôt work like that. Taggers (aka mobbers) sometimes claim two crews, but gangs don‚Äôt do this.

 In terms of formality, cholos will wear their uniform (any type of shorts, sports jerseys, Nike shoes, socks pulled up high, hoodie) and that‚Äôs as far as it goes. They don‚Äôt live by a code, they don‚Äôt idolize that dumb motto. These guys lives are simple: never snitch,always bang on/press the enemy, never disrespect the set, drink modelos, smoke weed, and just kickback with the family. When a cholo intimidates a high schooler or whatever, it‚Äôs because they suspect him to be from another hood, or maybe because they are drunk and teasing random people. Of course there are members that are crazy and sick in head but that‚Äôs about less than 10% of them. Around 5% of MS affiliated members are the people committing those atrocious machete attacks. But other than that, the rest are just lazy, uneducated people that have never been shown anything else better in life. They don‚Äôt go around carrying attacks on pretty innocent little white girls, like wtf, how do people belong this.",Liberal,1576891678,PCNoob111,0,1,True,2019-12-20
Anyone have a good impeachment fact timeline?,[removed],Liberal,1576896220,pdxjtj86,3,1,True,2019-12-20
We (the people) have a job to do,"While the president is impeached, I can't help but worry that many of us are claiming this as a victory too soon. My reasoning for this concern is simply because while Trump is a dumbass when it comes to running the country, he is powerful with his toxic rhetoric. The crap he spews is toxic in two ways; first and foremost he says what his base wants to hear in order to keep them loyal, angry and divisive towards us. The second way his voice is toxic is that it exhausts us, every time we hear his lies it wears us down, we wonder how long it will take until he's gone, but at the same time our motivation to stand up against him also drops.

We have a job to do. We cannot depend on presidential candidates and other politicians to tear away support from Trump and energize Democrats that have become too exhausted to even look at the news. It is our jobs, as neighbors of these Democrats and Republicans alike, to reach out to them and convince them that Trump needs to be taken down in every way possible.

With what I just said, I know many of you get intimidated by the thought if reaching out to Trump supporters, or Republicans in general, but let me explain why it is so important that we do this. People who are still loyal to Trump are only loyal because they are slaves to his rhetoric, they believe that he is Making America Great because he's saying that he is, but what are the facts? The fact is, while it may be extremely difficult to convince a red to become a blue, at the very least when we talk to our neighbors about how very little Trump actually cares about America, we may at least exhaust them like Trump has exhausted us. If we can exhaust enough of his base, he will lose significant support at the polls. If you know your neighbor well enough and know what they stand for tell them Donald doesn't stand with them. For example if you have a Christian neighbor who is pro life, talk to them about the many ways Trump has neglected children in his immigration and health care reforms, cite the recent Christian article supporting impeachment and Trumps many sins. 

Tl;Dr When it comes to Trump supporters, we need to talk to them in a way that may convince them that Trump isn't a godly being, he's a greedy, charismatic demon that manipulated America for personal gain. Talking to trump supporters may not net Democrats a lot of votes, but it will drop the amount of Republican ones.

(And when speaking with people who you disagree with dont yell or throw insults at them, because that just pushes them further away.)

Now as for how we speak to fellow democrats and independents who have been exhausted, the first thing we need to acknowledge is that they may be content with the fact that the president was impeached. The deed is done, we won right? Wrong. Tell them Trump isn't down yet. He has the power and the toxicity to win again if we stay content with the fact that he was impeached. We need to make sure those who are exhausted wake up in time for the elections. We need all the power we can get to take the big man in office down for good.

We (the people) have a job to do. We can tear this greedy tyrant off his throne and we can begin to heal the division and hatred that he sew into the country.",Liberal,1576902633,buckster1014,0,1,True,2019-12-20

Time to see some legislation,"I have watched the impeachment proceedings with mild interest since they started.   It's over now.   Sure it will eventually go to the Senate, but it's never going to pass there.   Now I want some legitimate action from the Democrats.  

The excuse I've heard from people as to why we don't have an expansive health care bill, or college debt forgiveness bill, or Net Neutrality legislation, is ""The Senate will never pass it.""

That no longer holds any water.  We have spent several months on a dead end impeachment proceeding.  Not a single Republican in the house voted for it, so there is no way 20 Republicans will do so in the Senate.  Let's get real legislation passed in the House, now.   Let's have something that the Democrats can point to in November that voters can have tangible proof of honest attempts at change.   10 more months of pointing at Trump as the boogyman, while not actually doing the work of Congress, is going to get this country 4 more years of the Cheeto.

SUBJECT: Hempire Direct Employee Notice

Dear Hempire Direct Employee,

As you know our president is getting impeached.

I‚Äôve seen all the funny memes you guys share on your Facebook, and chatter in the office.

But let me make one thing clear.

Trump signed the farm bill, this bill is what allowed me to create this company and for you to have a job.

Trump also plans to sign other bills that will add be if it‚Äôs and revenue to our growing little company.

Voting for anyone else is 2020 is like saying you don‚Äôt want to be employed.

And that‚Äôs fine. So if you vote some someone else we can still be friends, but you know where the door is because that tell me you don't want this company to succed.

\#trumptrain2020

Sincerely,

Ben Boyce

[Serious] How has European history affected the state of modern day American Politics?,"The Battle of Calais took place in the morning of 1 January 1350, during the Hundred Years' War. English troops who occupied the French city of Calais ambushed and defeated an unsuspecting French force which was attempting to take the city. Despite a truce being in effect the French commander Geoffrey de Charny had planned to take the city by subterfuge, and bribed Amerigo of Pavia, an Italian officer of the city garrison, to open a gate for them. The English King, Edward III, became aware of the plot and personally led his household knights and the Calais garrison in a surprise counter-attack. The French were routed by this smaller force, with significant losses and all of their leaders captured or killed.

With that in mind, how do you think the current state of American politics has been influenced by this event?",Liberal,1577904607,DiarrheaDexter,2,1,True,2020-01-01

"Mitch McConnell, do the right thing. Either tell all the Republicans to vote ""Yes"" to the House passed Impeachment resolution for Trump's removal . Or encourage Trump's cabinet members to write 25th Amendment to the Constitution and send you the same ASAP to confine Trump in a mental institution.","There is no doubt in my mind as well as in the minds of many Americans that Trump is the ultimate threat to our Republic, not Iran or nor it's Mullahs, especially not their supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Therefore to save our great country from total destruction at the hands of Trump and his minions, Congress will do a lot better to speed up Trump's removal from power immediately.

Mitch McConnell should forget about himself and think about 'America First'. 

&amp;#x200B;

But we also know why the current Senate Majority leader is called a ""Grim Reaper"" or a ""Moscow Mitch"" . Because that is what he is, a grim reaper and a stooge of President Putin of Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand if he still wants to save this country from total destruction at the hands of his friend and his partner in crime called Donald John Trump, Mr. McConnell will put the impeachment Resolution on the Senate floor right away after telling every Republican Senators to vote in favor of removing Trump from presidency without any further delay.

My job is very heavily influenced by the foreign metal tariffs and anti-dumping suits so he was focusing on that. Coworker #2's contributions to the discussion started with ""I think he's doing a great job and you won't convince me otherwise"" which then quickly devolved into repeated ""I don't care"" and finished with ""your opinion doesn't matter to me so shut up"".

* It is false that all people should (morally speaking) try their best to avoid buying products from factory farms.

&amp;#x200B;

Its worded in such a way to imply were not removing factory because people might be in circumstances where they can only afford foods that were generated at a factory farm.

The other side might be that some may live in an area where a store might only provide factory-farmed goods.

An outsider's lens,"

Non-American here , so go easy on me if I get something wrong. I have followed American media for a number of years, though not closely as some of you do , but more than a cursory glance. I can't help that part of me chuckles a bit that things appear to be bit like a circus. People getting riled up all the time or eking out every possible ounce of information out there to suit their narrative. There is some sort of programming and repetitiveness of it all, that you almost exactly know what is going to appear next week in the media including reddit. The quality of a forum is determined by what it makes popular, I'd guess. Why do you think are we seeking the same stimulation, gathering the evidence we want to suit ourselves, and posting it to gratify ourselves knowing others in the forum would certainly agree with us? There is an unmistakable cycle to it and if we sort of saw it outside of ourselves we would have called them automatons. 

It is due to the above observation that I feel that we have room for self reflection and to take a step back and become more conscious of what's going on . That could maybe start by examining ones motivations in posting a comment and see if whether it's for getting a few upvotes or challenging the structures on which our beliefs stand. My understanding and interpretation of a liberal is to question the status quo, whats more liberal than challenging our own status quo of thoughts and beliefs and getting more aware of what's going on underneath. From this self reflection, it's my belief that one'd be more empathetic to the opposing viewpoint because you'd somewhere deep down know, if you are honest to yourself that you dont know all of what's out there  and many of your views dont have a solid footing. On the contrary, everyone knows everything and exactly know why they act and can articulate within themselves of the hard evidence vouching for the conviction of their beliefs.

"Why do liberals generally oppose and mock Christianity, but protect or defend Islamic culture?","Liberals will defend Islamic cultures by claiming that any criticism of these cultural practices are ‚Äòislamophobic‚Äô and xenophobic, but when it pertains to Christians, liberals seem to vehemently oppose those traditional practices. 

For example, in relation to the LGBT community, the Bible teaches that marriage is among a man and a woman. In response to such belief, liberals often scream ‚Äúbigotry!‚Äù or ‚Äúhomophobia!‚Äù ‚Äî 
But when the Quran states that homosexuals should be put to death, the response from liberals is silence. I don‚Äôt understand!

Liberals will passionately oppose Christian doctrines on the basis that they‚Äôre bigoted, while simultaneously remaining silent or even tolerating Islamic views, which are strictly enforced to the point of capital punishment.

A Call To Arms," 

Sunday July 26th 2020. Mark that day in your calendars. That is ADA Awareness Day and the date selected for a March For Disability Rights. Due to the nature of our community, it is not feasible for everyone to march in DC, so I am calling for volunteers to organize your city for a coordinated march across America. Just how do you do that? Well, this is my first time too, but I have ideas on that. Look of the list of potential contacts to help you along.

Center for Independent Living: an organization dedicated to helping mobility disabled become independent

Political Parties

Any agency dealing with disability and/or disease.

Local media. Most media would love to get this story. The free advertising can attract additional people to march in solidarity.

College Greeks: Fraternities and sororities need social events to participate in.

Your local representatives at city, state and federal levels

Organizers should be prepared to be interviewed by local and/or national media

.

So what are we marching for? Improvements on the ADA particularly on enforcement. Better clarification on what constitutes ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù accommodations. A Bill of Rights like every other minority. We want to be heard in the design of an universal health care bill, as we have special needs that must be addressed. Universal loan forgiveness for the disabled that doesn't require jumping through hoops. Most of all, a livable income. SSI has not kept up with inflation. Section 8 has not kept up with inflation. We are tired of just existing. I dare say, none of us ASKED to become disabled. We deserve the same respect the able bodied get and not looked at with contempt. Lastly, we are sick and tired of being the primary target whenever legislators start trimming the budget and we demand permanent protections written into law.

This protest is just beginning, so if you have anything you would like to be included, by all means speak up. You will never get the change you seek by remaining quiet. We must let America know we are here, we are never leaving and we want equal treatment under the law. I would like to suggest legislators create a counsel of like minded individuals to speak on behalf of our community and provide suggestions for what to include in legislation and new programs that would benefit us. Do I have any heroes to promote our cause? If you are on any other social network site, please spread the word.",Liberal,1572375660,IdaCrackersGhost,2,1,True,2019-10-29

Question regarding gun laws from a non-American,"Hello, 

I have a question for democrats in America regarding the gun laws. I come from Switzerland which has relatively liberal gun laws (even when compared to states such as California, New York, etc) and one of the lowest overall and *gun* murder rates. For instance, our gun murder rate ranks below that of Australia which is perhaps cited the most of any nation in this debate and has very stringent legislation.

Here are our laws summed up: https://imgur.com/a/6pMVf87

Now when compared to most US states, our laws are substantially more stricter. However when compared to California and such, our laws are actually more lenient. For instance we do not have an ""assault weapon"" or magazine capacity ban.
My question is if Democrats would support an adoption of Swiss laws nationwide under two conditions:
No state is allowed to have stricter laws than the federal ones. That means states like Cali, NJ, etc aren't allowed to pass AWBs.
A constitutional amendment that stipulates any further tightening of the law requires two-thirds of the populace and states to agree (same as my country.)

Would Dems satisfied with such laws if they were adopted in tandem with measures such as univeral healthcare, far greater funding for mental care, a reduction in poverty and wealth inequality rates, etc? Honestly curious.",Liberal,1572582898,sebring__,0,1,True,2019-11-01

U.S. Elections Happening This Tuesday (Don't Forget to Vote!),"Please remember to vote! Below are key elections to watch on Tuesday, but this is by no means a comprehensive list, so be sure to [**find your polling place**](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/) and [read up on what you'll be voting on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_elections).

### Gubernatorial Elections

* [Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Kentucky_gubernatorial_election): One-term Republican Matt Bevin is seeking re-election. In the May 21 primaries, Bevin held off three opponents to win the Republican primary. He will face Attorney General Andy Beshear, who defeated two challengers in the Democratic primary. The latest poll from Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy has the two candidates in a dead heat.
* [Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mississippi_gubernatorial_election): Faced with an open seat due to current Gov. Phil Bryant‚Äôs term limits, Democrats could potentially stage an upset in this historically Republican state. While Mississippi hasn‚Äôt elected a Democrat to the role since 1999, the two state officials competing for the seat ‚Äî Attorney General Jim Hood (D) and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R) ‚Äî are within striking distance of one another. 

### Legislative Elections

* [Virginia General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly): Republicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins. Democrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.
* Legislative elections will be held for both houses of the [Louisiana Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Legislature), the [Mississippi Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Legislature), and the lower house of the [New Jersey Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Legislature).  

### Mayoral Elections

* [San Francisco, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_San_Francisco_mayoral_election): London Breed, the first African American woman the city has elected for mayor, is now running for a full term.
* [South Bend, IN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_South_Bend,_Indiana_mayoral_election): Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg won‚Äôt be running for reelection but he‚Äôs endorsed his former chief of staff James Mueller. Mueller is the favorite in a race against public school teacher and Republican candidate Sean Haas.
* [Philadelphia, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Philadelphia_mayoral_election): Kenney is running on raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, maintain supervised injection sites and the city's soda tax, and ensure the city's compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Ciancaglini promises to end Philadelphia's status as a sanctuary city and to cancel plans to establish sites where people can legally inject heroin. No Republican has won a Philadelphia mayoral election since Bernard Samuel in 1947

### Ballot Measures

* [Washington State](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_elections,_2019): The use of affirmative action in Washington state as it relates to government jobs and state universities has been barred since 1998, when voters approved a measure banning it. This year, voters will have the option to reinstate affirmative action.
* [New York City, NY](https://ballotpedia.org/City_elections_in_New_York,_New_York_(2019)): A ballot initiative asks voters whether they‚Äôd like to use ranked-choice voting in races such as the mayor‚Äôs election and the city council race. If the initiative passes, it would bring ranked-choice voting to the most populous city in the country, a huge step for pro-ranked-choice reform efforts.

Why do Liberals defend Islamic culture but attack Christianity?,"Liberals will defend Islamic cultures by claiming that any criticism of these cultural practices are ‚Äòislamophobic‚Äô and xenophobic, but when it pertains to Christians, liberals seem to vehemently oppose those traditional practices. 

For example, in relation to the LGBT community, the Bible teaches that marriage is among a man and a woman. In response to such belief, liberals often scream ‚Äúbigotry!‚Äù or ‚Äúhomophobia!‚Äù ‚Äî 
But when the Quran states that homosexuals should be put to death, the response from liberals is silence. I don‚Äôt understand!

Liberals will passionately oppose Christian doctrines on the basis that they‚Äôre bigoted, while simultaneously remaining silent or even tolerating Islamic views, which are strictly enforced to the point of capital punishment. 

Why do liberals prefer to defend an even more strict version of abrahamic doctrines, calling anyone who criticizes such a culture ‚Äúbigoted‚Äù, while at the same time opposes the less-strict version? It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.",Liberal,1573236287,InGodWeTrust96,0,1,True,2019-11-08

Full Transcript of Beto O'Rourke's August 15 Speech on White Nationalist Terrorism,"Transcript by /u/Privacy__Account

Good morning! Buenos d√≠as! Isn't it beautiful to hear the El Paso High band practicing behind us? We may hear the strains of the next song coming through over the course of this conversation but I was just thinking about the fact that Charlotte and I‚Äîraised by Melissa and Pat, along with our sister Erin‚Äîgrew up about four blocks from here. And, when I would walked to El Paso High, I would walk through this park, climb over this wall, and make my way to the side of this mountain and see Chris and Jim and Robert and our friends at El Paso High. And, it‚Äôs definitely a part of who I am, helped to form me and shape me, and makes me so proud of this community, who we are, just looking out at everyone who has taken the time to be here this morning.

I just want to begin with my gratitude and my thanks, and an expression of my overwhelming pride in this community at this moment. After this horrific tragedy on August 3rd, where 22 lives were taken from us, dozens more injured and still grieving, many still at Del Sol and University Medical Center not yet through the woods but being pulled through by their families and their friends and this community. The way that we have met this tragedy, though we were targeted because we are a community of immigrants, because we are a community that is 85% Mexican American, though they tried to define us by our differences, and we showed just how strong we are, and I hope gave an example to the rest of the country about who we can become as America.

 

Last week we went over to the memorial that‚Äôs just outside of the Walmart, and we were paying our respects along with hundreds of El Pasoans. There was a band playing; there were matachines dancing; there were preachers praying; there were families who just in silence, and through tears, were trying to take in what had just happened to this community, and to this country, and to all of us.

And I remember that a chaplain found me and brought me over. He said, there is somebody that I would like you to meet. And he introduced me to a gentleman named Antonio, who was kneeling in front of a cross, and on that white cross in black paint it said ‚ÄúMargie.‚Äù

And the chaplain told me, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been here every single since that terrorist act. In front of the cross that represents his wife, that woman he loved, that woman with whom he built a life, that woman who means everything to him. He doesn't have other family in this community, doesn't have a lot of friends right now to grieve with, but I want you to go meet him and I want you to ask him about his story.‚Äù

And I did, and I went up to Antonio and he told me about Margie, and the most beautiful smile broke through on his face, and I thought of the grace he was showing to me and others who were there to mourn with him. You could forgive him if he was consumed by his grief and didn't want to talk to, or listen to, or be with, any of us‚Ä¶ but that wasn't the way that he responded.

And then the chaplain‚Äîand I didn't know how this would work out‚Äîhe said, ‚ÄúAntonio, stand up, tell the hundreds of people here about your wife Margie.‚Äù And shyly, in a voice you could almost not hear at first, he did that. He began to tell his wife‚Äôs story.

And then the chaplain said, ‚ÄúEverybody come around, this guy needs a hug right now.‚Äù And then one after another, tens then dozens, hundreds of El Pasoans surrounded him, and hugged him, and put their hands on him, and he was crying and it was so powerful and cathartic for him, for us, for this community, and anyone in this nation who was taking the time to watch what was happening. And that‚Äôs just one of many stories we that we‚Äôve learned, and that we‚Äôve witnessed over the last two weeks.

 

Flying home from Las Vegas, Nevada, when I got the news, a young gentleman named Chris walks up to me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm flying back to El Paso as well, because I just learned that my mother, Rosemary, has been shot at that Walmart. I have no idea how she‚Äôs doing, what her condition is, nothing! No news.‚Äù

And I said, ‚ÄúIf it is any help, I, and my wife Amy, would love to join you.‚Äù

And he said, ‚ÄúThat would be great. I could use the help right now.‚Äù

And, we went over to UMC. When you walked into that room, Chris, and your mother Rosemary‚Äîwho had been shot in the chest, both of her lungs perforated, tubes coming out of her chest snaking through the hospital sheet, coming down onto the floor, a mask over her face‚Äîand the biggest smile I have ever seen produced by another human being, to see you in that room. And for your sisters to be there as well, and the strength and grace to greet me, a complete stranger in her life, and to make sure that I felt welcomed in her intensive care unit hospital room. To meet the nurses and the doctors and the frontline staff that were going to make sure that she was going to make it. And, I wonder to myself, where in the world does she get that strength and that courage? Well, the next day at Del Sol hospital I found the answer.

It was her mother, who was in her early 80s, who was shot in the stomach. And though she was shot, in the aftermath of that shooting she tended tended to other victims in the parking lot and inside of the store before she ever thought about the wounds she that was walking with‚Ä¶ that ultimately forced her to have to sit down, and then lay down, and to be taken into a hospital where again her life was saved, by extraordinary El Pasoans from this this community.

One of whom, when she was on her way into her shift, the doctor stopped me and she said, ‚ÄúHey, Beto, I love the way this community is coming together right now, and I just want you to know that I‚Äôm going into my shift right now. I‚Äôm a doctor, I‚Äôm going to keep saving these lives, but I also want you to know that I‚Äôm an immigrant. I‚Äôm not unlike so many people in this community, so many millions in America who by their very presence and their sacrifice and their service make this country great.‚Äù

 

This is a beautiful community, one of if not the safest cities in the United States of America. Safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants. More than a quarter who live here came here, chose us, left to their hometown, their family, their culture, their language far too often, to start anew here as strangers in a strange land, to do better for themselves and for their kids, but also to do better for us. And they have. And this connection that we have with Ciudad Juarez is one of the most beautiful that you will find between two cities from two countries anywhere in the world. Three million, with two histories, two nationalities joined‚Äînot separated‚Äîby the Rio Grande river, forming something far greater, and more powerful, than the sum of their parts or the number of people involved.

We went to one of the funerals in Ciudad Juarez. Eight Mexican nationals killed on that date here in our community. And again, the grace that those survivors and families showed in the face of such adversity and pain and suffering, that I can only imagine‚Äîit made us sad as well but it also inspired us, with the strength and the courage that they showed.

 

We owe this community time to heal. We owe one another our very best. As those families may get through the toughest days they have ever known, the toughest days we have ever known. But from what I have seen since August 3rd, this community, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, is more than up to the task. There is an embarrassment of riches of kindness, and compassion, and help, and service, in El Paso right now. You know that because you are part of that. But I think we also owe ourselves, this community, the families that have been affected, answers about why this happened here in El Paso. Answers about what it is going to take to ensure this does not continue to happen in El Paso, or in communities like ours or anywhere across the United States.

I begin with the gun that was used in that act of terror and the number of guns we have in this country right now. You may have read the news that the killer's mother, when she learned he had ordered an AK-47 and had received it, called the police in Allen, Texas.

‚ÄúWhat does my son, who is not enlisted in the military, who has no need for a weapon of war, no training in it, what does he need with this gun?‚Äù

Though she may not have known how to articulate the question, she was asking for help for herself, for her son, and really by extension for this country. I know from listening to the surgeons and the doctors who have treated these gunshot victims at Del Sol and UMC‚Äîsome of whom also served at William Beaumont Army Medical Center, have been trained in combat trauma care‚Äîthe wounds they are seeing are like the wounds that they saw in Afghanistan and Iraq. These weapons, like the AK-47, were designed to kill people as effectively, as efficiently, and as great a number as possible, and that is exactly what they are doing. When you listen to the doctors describe the internal injuries of these survivors, it is absolutely horrifying.

But to this point, we have a Congress too craven to act; a democracy not up to the task, that favors those who can pay for access and influence and outcomes; the complicity and the silence of those who are in positions of public trust; and that is exactly what has happened here in this country. We have a racism in America that is as old as America itself; an intolerance towards those who do not look like, or pray like, or love like, or speak like, the majority in this country. That‚Äôs part of our story. We absolutely need to tell it, to face it, to acknowledge it, if we are ever going to change it. But we have always tried, until now, to change that.

 

Until this President, who so openly speaks in racist terms, so openly favors one race, one religion, one kind of people in this country over every other kind of people in this country. Proposing to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion, one faith, from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over, from every walk of life, from every tradition of faith.

It is hard to imagine this is happening in America, but it is happening in America. To tell people of color, born in this country, to go back to where they came from. To describe Klansmen, and Neo-Nazis, and white supremacists, and white nationalist terrorists, as ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù after they have marched and chanted, ‚ÄúJews, you will not replace us.‚Äù

Someone in his maiden speech for the highest office in the land‚Äîthe greatest position of power and public trust‚Äîwho described Mexican immigrants‚Äîthough they commit crimes at a lower rate than those born in this country‚Äîas ‚Äúrapists‚Äù and ‚Äúcriminals.‚Äù Constantly warns through incessant repetition of ‚Äúinvasions‚Äù and ‚Äúinfestations‚Äù and calls people‚Äîhuman beings, let's be clear, the most desperate and vulnerable human beings fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet, showing up here without a dime to their name, without any prospect of hope or advancement except that they came here to this country of asylum-seekers and refugees and immigrants, this country known by the Statue of Liberty‚Äîhe calls them ‚Äúanimals,‚Äù and ‚Äúpredators,‚Äù and ‚Äúkillers.‚Äù

And this May, of this year, in Florida, as he warns about this ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù and he asks the question to the assembled masses, ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do to stop these people?‚Äù

And someone yells out, ‚ÄúShoot them!‚Äù

And the crowd roars their approval. In the face of that, the President signals his consent: he smiles, he laughs, he encourages more of it.

 

Every single year for the last three, hate crimes have been on the rise in this country. Those counties that hosted a Donald Trump rally saw hate crimes increase by more than 200%. I want to make clear to you, to us, to the country, that what he says and what he does, does not just offends our sensibilities, or our understanding of the traditions of this great country, it changes who we are as a country.

You do not get kids in cages until you have given people permission to put them in cages, by calling them animals, and seeking to dehumanize them. You don't lose the lives of seven children in the custody and care of the wealthiest, the most powerful country on the face of the planet, unless you have made it possible. And you do not get somebody driving 600 miles to come to this community‚Äîin his manifesto repeating the very words used by the President of the United States to justify this act of terror, and hatred, and violence, and death.

And yet in the face of this, our institutions have failed us.

And in this democracy, none of us can take any comfort or feel in any way superior, because all of us are part of the institutions; whether it is our Legislature, our Congress, the press, social media, they are all comprised of all of us. But they have been impotent in the face of the gravest threat that we have ever known, one that we experienced firsthand here in El Paso a week ago Saturday. It‚Äôs almost as if the bigger the lie, the more obvious the injustice, the more furious the pace of this bizarre behavior, the more incapable we are of seeing it and clearly naming it and acting against it.

 

This attack on El Paso is an attack on America. It is an attack on our ideal of what America can be, an America that has not been for so many in this country, based on their race, their ethnicity, their country of national origin, their gender, their sexual orientation. As Langston Hughes said in his poem about an America that was not an America for everyone, it is the land that has never been yet, and yet must be.

It is in this land, in this very community, after the election of this President, at LBJ Elementary, that a third-grade student approached us and asked, ‚ÄúWhy does the president not like me?‚Äù

It‚Äôs in this country, in Houston, Texas, when I retold the story that a family came to me and they said, ‚ÄúIt resonates with us because we have a third-grader in our home. She's not Mexican-American, she's Muslim, and she wonders if there is some other country we are supposed to go back to. Though she was born here, though she‚Äôs a US citizen here, though she's just as American as anyone else.‚Äù

When we allow this country to be defined along lines of race, and ethnicity, and religion; when we allow a commander-in-chief to not only welcome that but the violence that follows, to defy our laws, our institutions, and any ethical or moral boundaries; the end of that road is the end of this idea of America. The end of an America where every single one of us could belong and have a future.

I'm confident that if, at this moment, we do not wake up to this threat, then we, as a country, will die in our sleep.

 

The response to this has to be that each of us make a commitment to see clearly, to speak honestly, and to act decisively in this moment of truth. I, for one, see more clearly than ever that in a country that has 320 million people, but 390 million firearms, that we have too many guns‚Äîtoo many people who own them, and use them, and threaten us with them right now‚Äîfor the good of this country, for the good of the 40,000 of our fellow Americans, our fellow human beings, who will lose their lives to gun violence this year and every year going forward until we change course.

And I see more clearly than I ever have, that not only do we need universal background checks, not only do we need red flag laws that would stop somebody when they pose a danger to themselves or someone else, not only do we need to end the sale of assault weapons and weapons of war that were designed for the battlefield and have no place in our communities, but we must as a country buy those weapons, take them off the streets altogether. There are millions of them today. And their ability to inspire terror, to make our kids and your kids afraid to walk into that classroom at Mesita [elementary school] or El Paso High because we know as a country, we‚Äôve accepted the murder of 6- and 7-year-old children where they sat at school, we‚Äôve accepted high school students being hunted down in the halls of these institutions like El Paso High right behind me.

It is time for us to be bold, to stand together, to stand up against those interests who would prevent us from saving the lives of our fellow Americans.

 

It is more clear to me now than it has ever been before, that when we do not make progress on the human dignity of our fellow Americans, the ability to work a job‚Äîand just one job, not two or three because you‚Äôre paid a living wage‚Äîto be able to depend on healthcare as something that‚Äôs a right that you don‚Äôt have to worry about, so that you‚Äôre well enough to live to your full potential; to know that your community, that you, and your family count; not only is it the right thing to do, to make sure that this country is realizing its full potential and promise for every single one of us, when we fail to do that, you provide fertile ground for the kind of demagogues we have an office right now, who will use your fear and your frustration against you, against us, against one another. Demonize immigrants and minorities, blame them for the problems that you have.

I see more clearly now than I ever have before, that immigrants in this community, in this state, in this country, will continue to be attacked‚Äînot just killed as they were at the Walmart but terrorized as we just saw last week in Mississippi. Six hundred people who came to this country for the privilege of working the toughest, shittiest jobs that no one else here would allow their children to work, in chicken processing plants, in picking cotton, in working in the gin, working two or three shifts, maybe making minimum wage if they are lucky. Far too often, their immigration status used as leverage against them to pay them something far less or nothing at all. [Microphone stops working for one sentence.]

This has, in part, caused this kind of treatment of the people who make America great, who are part of who we are, the very fabric of our lives, and the response to that is no more being defensive, or being on the back foot, or apologizing for who we are and who we want to be. It is using the example of El Paso, Texas, and showing that when we legalize those who are in this country; when we free DREAMers from any fear of deportation by making them US citizens; when we elevate the asylum-seekers, the refugee, that person who has no other hope or choice but to come here; not only is it good for them, it is great for the United States of America, and fundamental to any success, or strength, or safety, or security we could hope to have. And I see more clearly than I ever have before that if we do not tell our story, others will tell it for us. This proud community has to tell the world just who we are, and what made us so special; and to remind ourselves that though we have something absolutely extraordinary here in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, though we are separated by hundreds of miles from the other centers of power and population, as Martin Luther King reminded us, we were all caught in this inextricable, inescapable network of mutuality, we are tied in a single garment of destiny. Sooner or later the challenges, the problems of this country will come find you, as they came and found us on August 3rd.

So telling the full, and real, and true story of this country‚Äîjust who made us great in the first place, on whose backs America was built, and whose descendants could profit from it and whose descendants were virtually locked out from it‚Äîand knowing that and confronting it directly, clear eyed, gives us the best chance of writing the next chapter of that story, whose ideal and goal and vision must be true and real equality and equity for every single one of us. Every single American treated with the dignity and respect that they are owed as Americans, as human beings, just the way that we do it here in El Paso, Texas.

 

Monday, Amy and I took Ulysses and Molly and Henry to school. This morning, we rushed them out the door, Janine gave them a ride to Mesita [elementary school] and to Wiggs [middle school], and I've got to tell you, there's some part of me‚Äîit's a big part of me‚Äîthat wants to stay here, and be with my family, and be with my community. I love El Paso. There have even been some who suggested that I stay in Texas and run for Senate. But that would not be good enough for this community. That would not be good enough for El Paso. That would not be good enough for this country. We must take the fight directly to the source of this problem. That person who has caused this pain and placed this country in this moment of peril, and that is Donald Trump. [applause] I want to be the leader for this country that we need right now and that we do not have. Someone who will not only not tear us apart but do everything within their power to bring us together; someone who doesn't inflame but instead heals; somebody doesn't work with fear but instead, hope. In other words, I want to be the kind of leader for this country that El Paso has raised me and taught me to be.

 

But as we head back on the campaign trail today, I know there is a way [applause] I know there is a way to do this better, and that came to me last week. Someone asked if I going to be heading back to Iowa to go to the Iowa state fair: corndogs and Ferris wheels.

And I said, ‚ÄúNo, I can't go back for that. But I also cannot go back to that.‚Äù

The kind of challenges that we face in this country at this moment of crisis require an urgency, unless we want to reap the consequences of failing to meet them, consequences that we lived and I hope learned from in El Paso on August 3rd. And so to those places where Donald Trump has been terrorizing, and terrifying, and demeaning our fellow Americans, that's where you'll find me in this campaign. [applause] From El Paso we are heading to Mississippi to be with those families who have lost a loved one‚Äîtemporarily, maybe for the indefinite future‚Äîbecause of hostility of this administration towards immigrants. And I want to be there to help lift them up, to tell their story, to remind this country just who we are at our best. Anyone that this president puts down, we're going to do our best to lift up. [applause] In those communities, so long forgotten, counted out, not counted in to begin with, we're going to go there as well, not only to learn about their challenges and their problems, but as is so often the case, to learn from them about the solutions to their challenges and the problems; their solutions to our challenges and problems as a country; places all over the country, places like El Paso.

Though we bore the brunt of this attack, of this hatred, of this violence, of this country‚Äôs inaction in the face of these threats, I also know that this community holds the answers not just for our future here in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, but the future of this country. We see our differences not as dangerous or disqualifying, not just to be tolerated or respected, but to be embraced as fundamental to any hope we have of making it as a community, of making it as a country. I'm so fortunate to have been raised in this community, with Amy to be raising our children in this community, to be here right now in this community. I just want to promise you that every single day of this campaign, I will take the courage and the kindness, the warmth, the strength, the resolve of this community with me, and I will share it with the rest of the country. Because we and El Paso, and I hope that we as Americans, still believe that though we have not realized the idea of America for everyone, it is still within our grasp, and we the people of the border can lead the way.

Serious question: how do we fix the mess we‚Äôre in? I‚Äôm scared for my future.,"I swear I‚Äôm almost at the point of giving up. It‚Äôs not worth it any more. It seems like the president and the rest of the right-wing in this country has spent their time the last few years more as wrecking balls than politicians. They haven‚Äôt worked to improve or positively advance policy (which is what I believe any politician should do regardless of affiliation), they‚Äôve just made a point to destroy every little inch forward liberal voters and politicians have made. 

Let‚Äôs be honest, to rebuild is going to take way longer than it took to destroy. With the rise of far-right individuals increasingly coming in to power, I fear that it‚Äôs too late- we can‚Äôt ever achieve a string of liberal or democratic politicians in power long enough to bring us back to where we were before, or further. 

I‚Äôm taking things like the environment, which we‚Äôre not going to save in time because the political establishment doesn‚Äôt give half a damn. I‚Äôm talking the basic human rights violations on the border. I‚Äôm talking major election fraud and corruption. It‚Äôs just going to get worse. 

I want things to change. I really really do. It seems like as a young person, while all of you respect that we deserve a future, the current establishment of republicans and other right-wingers do not. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm so so scared.",Liberal,1566567444,epicmylife,0,1,True,2019-08-23

"For liberals, what is your economic basis for justifying your belief system?","Hi everyone. I have a legitimate question for liberals. 

First off, for full disclosure I'm not a liberal. My beliefs are Marxist but I'm interested in seeing your perspective out of curiosity.

For some background, when I was younger I toyed around with some Libertarian beliefs and briefly transitioned through liberalism before settling on Marxism and socialism.

The main reason for this was that I felt there wasn't an economic basis or theory backing up the liberal ideology (American liberals by the way) and Marx's arguments were much stronger than any of the Libertarian and right wing arguments. 

So in short, what are the arguments (economic or philosophical) that justify the American liberal ideological perspective? How do they differ from right wing Republican beliefs and/or theories? Is there any reading recommendations that would better articulate liberal economic theory?

"The media's rhetorical ""point shaving"": How they constantly take a dive in coverage of Trump to prop up his insurgent regime.","No matter how storied the publication, how credentialed the author, or how plain the facts, you can be certain of a few things when the Token Opposition Media (TOM) covers anything related to Donald Trump:

* **Downplay or ignore the most relevant and powerful criticisms in favor of lesser ones.**

Free Media headline: ""Trump orders purge of Latinos from Pentagon leadership.""

Token Opposition Media (TOM) headline 1: ""Critics decry 'divisive' Trump shakeup in Pentagon leadership.""

TOM headline 2: ""House committee to review 'secretive' changes in Pentagon leadership.  Will demand answers, House Dems say."" 

* **Extremely wordy, vague, or drastically softened headline titles to muffle the impact of a story.**

Free Media headline: ""Neo-Nazi sleeper cell in ICE visited Trump five times, records show.""

TOM headline 1: ""Rights group claims cache of files reveals possible contacts between reputed extremists within immigration enforcement and political officials.""

TOM headline 2: ""Former Attorney General calls ICE files 'Extremely concerning,' calls for transparency.""

* **Constant, obsessive use of legitimizing euphemisms.**

Free Media headline: ""Trump demands $5 billion personal bribe from China not to impose further trade tariffs.""

TOM headline: ""US trade-war rhetoric denounced.""

Free Media headline: ""Trump appointee implicated in terror plot against Ohio synagogue.""

TOM headline: ""Administration's religious freedom initiative under fire for association with extremist groups.""

Why is everyone shitting on American cops?,"I get it. Some cops are absolute idiots. No I don‚Äôt condone innocent black men getting shot.

Well how about some more analogies. There have been nurses who kill patients. But yet the mass majority of nurses aren‚Äôt seen that way. There have been teachers who raped their students. Yet very few people look at teachers as rapists. So, in stark contrast to this, there have been a few scumbag cops who abused their power to kill innocent black men, and yet instead of most people viewing this as a rare occurrence like they do with killer nurses and rapist teachers, they view all cops as bad.

Radio Freedom on Kickstarter,"*Radio Freedom* is a compilation album, featuring twenty political/protest songs in all styles of music: metal, folk, hip hop, and more.

The long-term aim of the project is to establish a worker-owned, for-profit record label.

Politically-aware  musicians often have two choices: make money for a  company that goes  against everything they believe in, or go 'DIY' and  live in poverty.

Musicians shouldn't have to choose between making a difference and making a living.

The musicians on *Radio Freedom* will get a percentage which is well over the industry norm.

The funding goal represents the cost of mastering the songs, pressing the CDs, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The CDs will be manufactured by Austep Music, an environmentally-friendly music printing company.

Combat Liberalism,"We stand for active ideological struggle because it is the weapon for ensuring unity within the Party and the revolutionary organizations in the interest of our fight. Every Communist and revolutionary should take up this weapon.

But liberalism rejects ideological struggle and stands for unprincipled peace, thus giving rise to a decadent, Philistine attitude and bringing about political degeneration in certain units and individuals in the Party and the revolutionary organizations.

Liberalism manifests itself in various ways.

To let things slide for the sake of peace and friendship when a person has clearly gone wrong, and refrain from principled argument because he is an old acquaintance, a fellow townsman, a schoolmate, a close friend, a loved one, an old colleague or old subordinate. Or to touch on the matter lightly instead of going into it thoroughly, so as to keep on good terms. The result is that both the organization and the individual are harmed. This is one type of liberalism.

To indulge in irresponsible criticism in private instead of actively putting forward one's suggestions to the organization. To say nothing to people to their faces but to gossip behind their backs, or to say nothing at a meeting but to gossip afterwards. To show no regard at all for the principles of collective life but to follow one's own inclination. This is a second type.

To let things drift if they do not affect one personally; to say as little as possible while knowing perfectly well what is wrong, to be worldly wise and play safe and seek only to avoid blame. This is a third type.

Not to obey orders but to give pride of place to one's own opinions. To demand special consideration from the organization but to reject its discipline. This is a fourth type.

To indulge in personal attacks, pick quarrels, vent personal spite or seek revenge instead of entering into an argument and struggling against incorrect views for the sake of unity or progress or getting the work done properly. This is a fifth type.

To hear incorrect views without rebutting them and even to hear counter-revolutionary remarks without reporting them, but instead to take them calmly as if nothing had happened. This is a sixth type.

To be among the masses and fail to conduct propaganda and agitation or speak at meetings or conduct investigations and inquiries among them, and instead to be indifferent to them and show no concern for their well-being, forgetting that one is a Communist and behaving as if one were an ordinary non-Communist. This is a seventh type.

To see someone harming the interests of the masses and yet not feel indignant, or dissuade or stop him or reason with him, but to allow him to continue. This is an eighth type.

To work half-heartedly without a definite plan or direction; to work perfunctorily and muddle along--""So long as one remains a monk, one goes on tolling the bell."" This is a ninth type.

To regard oneself as having rendered great service to the revolution, to pride oneself on being a veteran, to disdain minor assignments while being quite unequal to major tasks, to be slipshod in work and slack in study. This is a tenth type.

To be aware of one's own mistakes and yet make no attempt to correct them, taking a liberal attitude towards oneself. This is an eleventh type.

We could name more. But these eleven are the principal types.

They are all manifestations of liberalism.

Liberalism is extremely harmful in a revolutionary collective. It is a corrosive which eats away unity, undermines cohesion, causes apathy and creates dissension. It robs the revolutionary ranks of compact organization and strict discipline, prevents policies from being carried through and alienates the Party organizations from the masses which the Party leads. It is an extremely bad tendency.

Liberalism stems from petty-bourgeois selfishness, it places personal interests first and the interests of the revolution second, and this gives rise to ideological, political and organizational liberalism.

People who are liberals look upon the principles of Marxism as abstract dogma. They approve of Marxism, but are not prepared to practice it or to practice it in full; they are not prepared to replace their liberalism by Marxism. These people have their Marxism, but they have their liberalism as well--they talk Marxism but practice liberalism; they apply Marxism to others but liberalism to themselves. They keep both kinds of goods in stock and find a use for each. This is how the minds of certain people work.

Liberalism is a manifestation of opportunism and conflicts fundamentally with Marxism. It is negative and objectively has the effect of helping the enemy; that is why the enemy welcomes its preservation in our midst. Such being its nature, there should be no place for it in the ranks of the revolution.

We must use Marxism, which is positive in spirit, to overcome liberalism, which is negative. A Communist should have largeness of mind and he should be staunch and active, looking upon the interests of the revolution as his very life and subordinating his personal interests to those of the revolution; always and everywhere he should adhere to principle and wage a tireless struggle against all incorrect ideas and actions, so as to consolidate the collective life of the Party and strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses; he should be more concerned about the Party and the masses than about any private person, and more concerned about others than about himself. Only thus can he be considered a Communist.

All loyal, honest, active and upright Communists must unite to oppose the liberal tendencies shown by certain people among us, and set them on the right path. This is one of the tasks on our ideological front.",Liberal,1567817576,That_Rate,8,0,True,2019-09-06

If you're liberal you probably hate the enormous wealth inequality in this country, so what if there was a limit on how wealthy an individual could be, and if any income would exceed that number it would be taken and distributed to the poorest people in America?

The number I'm thinking of is 3 billion dollars for an individual's total cash in the bank and asset value. But a business in its entirety has no limit, as that wouldn't make sense.

[Question] When someone complains about 'Buzz Words',"Hi, first of all, I don't live in an English speaking country and English is not my native language, so that might be why I'm asking this question.

I often notice that when someone that is debating points out that someone else is, for instance, a sexist, a racist or something like that, the people that use the term ""buzz words"" to refer to the allegation the first person made, are most likely to be conservative - is that right? It seems to an extent that almost everyone that uses the term ""buzz words"" is in fact a far-right supporter or something, or at least an alt-righter. Please help me understand this.

"To everyone here who has Twitter, I got an idea &amp; I need a favor...","Hey Berners, I have this good idea on how we can further get the word out about the progressive candidates I've been posting as of late.

Every so often that I scour Twitter looking for new names to add to my list &amp; every now &amp; then, I would come across some users &amp; even the candidates themselves that made a list of some of the progressive challengers that I post on Reddit every month. It was mostly thanks to the members on Twitter that I was able to expand my list &amp; update it constantly. I'd bet the progressive challengers on my list would get even more exposure if their Twitter handles would be spread far &amp; wide across the social media platform.

That's where you guys come in. I don't have Twitter or any social media for that matter. Since I know you guys are Twitter users, could y'all post/send the challengers' Twitter handles all across Twitter &amp; to the challengers themselves? It'd be greatly appreciated but not as much as the challengers looking to be elected.

Help getting through to my stepdad,"Hey there all,

I need your help getting through to my stepdad. We're both white, fyi.

I have been having some intense discussions with my parents recently and have hit a roadblock with my stepdad. My parents are both lifelong Democrats (my stepdad is a proud union member), which is obviously better than them being MAGA fans, but they are the old style of Democrat that didn't understand intersectionality, privelige, or structural racism. 

I have been trying to get him to understand that it is not just corporations and capitalism but white supremacy that creates structural inequality and violence in this country, but nothing really resonates with him. I have tried to show him good articles I have found online or books from my college library, but it just doesn't click and something he said recently really stuck with me because I hadn't ever really thought about it and I think it might be the key to getting him to wake up.

The thing that really hurt to hear him say when I was trying to talk with him about the 1619 project was that white people didn't enslave Africans because they were white, but that rich capitalists, who were white, did because they just had better technology than the Africans, and race wasn't the main factor.

I was trying to make him see how white culture is inherently oppressive and violent and he said ""well, why is it inherent? What makes it inherent?""

I asked him to explain and basically he says he doesn't buy into what I am telling him because it assumes that there is something different about white people from black or brown people, which he thinks is racist. Basically like is there something in white people's genes that make them racist and oppressive or did something in the past make white culture more violent and oppressive?

Basically I don't think I can convince him that white culture is more violent and hateful unless I can also tell him why it is more violent and hateful.",Liberal,1568615674,AllyHendrix1995,0,1,True,2019-09-16
Why Using Venezuela as an Example for Socialism Sucks,"Many Republicans point to the near failed state of Venezuala or the former USSR as reasons we should not adopt any socialist practices.

#4DayWeekUS,"Roughly a century ago, Henry Ford and Kelloggs reduced their employees' working hours from 6 days to 5 without reducing pay. FDR soon after made the 40 hour week the law of the land. Despite critics calling all of them out as un-American and anti-capitalist, workers and America prospered. Our economy soared and American families began an epic period of leisure and enrichment that helped foster community across America. People bowled together, knew one another, and got involved in civic and local activities. But as anyone familiar with Picketty knows, the last 4-plus decades saw a massive shift: even as our economy continued to outperform, only the richest Americans were enjoying the fruits of that productivity.

You want to know why poll after poll shows that this country supports progressive ideas more than conservative ones but still conservatives win more elections than they should? Because Americans are stressed out, exhausted, and just trying to make ends meet. There will be corporatist critics of the 4 Day Week, just as there were of the 5 Day Week a century ago, who say its a progressive pipe dream. But just as Ford and Kelloggs and FDR proved then, and we can prove now, it's no pipe dream. It's the answer to a lot of other problems...

SANTA ANA, Calif. ‚Äì A Chinese national pleaded guilty today to federal criminal charges for running an Orange County-based ‚Äúbirth tourism‚Äù business that catered to wealthy pregnant clients and Chinese government officials, charging them tens of thousands of dollars to help them give birth in the United States so their children would get U.S. citizenship.

Dongyuan Li (ÊùéÂÜ¨Â™õ), 41, of Irvine, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud and one count of visa fraud. Li was one of 19 defendants named in a series of indictments unsealed earlier this year which resulted from an massive probe by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement‚Äôs (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Los Angeles and IRS Criminal Investigation. Substantial assistance was provided by the Irvine Police Department and the San Bernardino County Sheriff‚Äôs Department.

Li is the first of the charged operators of birth tourism businesses to plead guilty. The remaining defendants either are pending trial or are fugitives.

Li admitted in her plea agreement that, from 2013 until March 2015, she operated a birth tourism company in Irvine and in China called You Win USA Vacation Services Corp. You Win would assist pregnant foreign nationals ‚Äì typically from China ‚Äì to travel to and remain in the United States to give birth so their children would receive birthright U.S. citizenship, according to the plea agreement.

According to a January 2019 federal grand jury indictment against Li, You Win advertised that it had served more than 500 Chinese birth tourism customers seeking U.S. birthright citizenship for their children. The indictment details that Li used 20 apartments in Irvine, charged each customer between $40,000 and $80,000, and she received $3 million in international wire transfers from China in two years.

Some You Win customers coached by the company made false statements on their visa applications and to U.S. immigration officials, Li‚Äôs plea agreement states. Li also admitted that the customers were advised on how to pass the U.S. Consulate interview in China, including by falsely stating that they were going to stay in the United States for only two weeks, when in reality, they planned to stay for up to three months to give birth.
‚ÄúHomeland Security Investigations remains committed to working in collaboration with our law enforcement partners to identify and dismantle criminal schemes designed to exploit our nation‚Äôs legal immigration system,‚Äù said Joseph Macias, special agent in charge for HSI Los Angeles. ‚ÄúI commend the HSI and IRS investigators who aggressively pursued a tip that uncovered one of the largest birth tourism schemes to date to be federally prosecuted.‚Äù

Li further admitted that her customers bypassed U.S. immigration controls by booking two flights ‚Äì the first from China to Hawaii and the second from Hawaii to Los Angeles International Airport ‚Äì because they thought it would be easier to clear U.S. Customs through Hawaii. Li‚Äôs customers also were coached how to trick U.S. Customs at ports of entry by concealing their pregnancies, according to the plea agreement.

In October 2013, Li made a $30,965 rent payment for Irvine apartments used in her birth tourism operation, and in November 2013, she made a $30,321 rent payment for those apartments, the plea agreement states.

As part of her plea agreement, Li agreed to forfeit more than $850,000, a Murrieta residence worth more than $500,000, as well as several Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

U.S. District Judge James V. Selna scheduled a December 16 sentencing hearing, at which time Li will face a statutory maximum sentence of 15 years in federal prison.

This case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California.

Mass immigration is accelerating climate change. We now have millions of immigrants living like wasteful westerners.,"Carbon Emissions. Immigration transfers populations of people from lower-polluting parts of the world to the United States, where CO2 emissions are far higher per person. According to a CIS study, U.S. immigrants produce an estimated 637 million tons of CO2 annually, which is 482 million tons more than these immigrants would have produced had they remained in their home countries.

Charisma is a better predictor of elections than actual policies,"It is clear to me that we need to pick the Democrat primary candidate with the most charisma.  Charisma is a better predictor of elections than actual policy!

For example:

Reagan, in spite of being a terrible president, had a lot of charisma and won in a landslide twice! 

John Kerry and Michael Dukakis had very little charisma, and they lost the presidency.  

Obama has a LOT of charisma, and won the presidency in an electoral landslide. But there is very little difference between Obama‚Äôs policies and the ones proposed by Hillary Clinton!  (Links below).   

Yet one of them won by a landslide, and the other lost, with virtually the same policies!   So what was the difference?   Charisma!

Among other factors of course, but this is important!

Then people say that Hillary lost the presidency because she was too ‚Äúcentrist.‚Äù   But Obama was centrist too!   

And do you know who else was centrist?   Bill Clinton!   And he won by a landslide TWICE!   In spite of several scandals!   What was the difference?   Charisma!

If we want to beat Trump, we need to pick a charismatic candidate!

IAAF agent 'asked Qatari royal' for $5m in bid for sporting events,"

   Leaked emails appear to link a member of the Qatari royal family to a deal   that is being investigated as part of a inquiry into alleged corruption   surrounding bids for the 2017 athletics world championships and   2020 Olympic Games.

French investigators have spent three years   scrutinising two payments of $3.5m made in October and November 2011, a month   before a vote by the International Association   of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to decide the host of the 2017   world championships. French investigators suspect the payments may have been   a bribe to win votes for Qatar for the event, which was eventually won by   London.

Emails seen by the Guardian and the French   website Mediapart, which are not in the French police file, suggest that the   disgraced IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack discussed a transfer   of money in emails to an account run by Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani,   just before the $3.5m payments were made. Al-Thani is a member of the royal   family and chief of staff to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was then the crown   prince and heir to the throne and became the emir of Qatar in 2013.

Massata Diack, who is wanted by Interpol on   corruption charges, begins one email to ‚ÄúSheikh Khalid‚Äù by telling him:   ‚ÄúThanks again for your hospitality and diligence during my stay in Doha,‚Äù   before providing his IAAF letter of affirmation that ‚ÄúQSI or Oryx QSI‚Äù is   asking.  
 

  ‚ÄúI do not owe it to them but to Your HH and yourself as you only know the   role I play in this matter,‚Äù he adds. HH appears to refer to Tamim Al Thani,   who was known as HH Heir Apparent when the letter was written in 2011.  
 

  The Guardian, which published part of this letter in 2014, has seen   evidence that points to ‚ÄúSheikh Khalid‚Äù being the chief of staff to the then   crown prince, based on an analysis with Mediapart of dozens of other emails   sent to the same Hotmail account, some of which use Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa   Al-Thani‚Äôs full name in Arabic.

In the email Massata Diack says: ‚ÄúYou will   find attached the bank details for the transfer of $4.5 million which must be   done as agreed.‚Äù In red ink he then adds: ‚ÄúThe balance of 440,000 must remain   in Doha in cash, I will pick it up the next time I come.‚Äù  
 

  Papa Massata Diack specifies that the payment must be made ‚Äúurgently today so   that I can finalize things with the president‚Äù and show him ‚Äúthe signed   contract and the bank confirmation‚Äù.  
 

  The ‚Äúpresident‚Äù in question appears to be his father Lamine, who was at the   time the IAAF president. Papa Massata Diack and Lamine Diack were this   week ordered to stand trial on charges of corruption and money   laundering by French authorities. They are accused of being part of a   conspiracy to bury positive drug tests by Russian athletes in   return for money. They all deny the charges.

As for the contract, it is believed to be   between Massata Diack‚Äôs company Pamodzi and Oryx QSI, the company headed by a   brother of Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of Paris Saint-Germain football   club and BeIN Sports.  
 

  Seven days later, Oryx QSI made a $3m transfer to Pamodzi. A second one of   $500,000 followed on 7 November 2011.

Neither Al-Thani or Al Thani responded to   the request for comment from the Guardian and Mediapart. Lamine Diack‚Äôs   lawyer also said he did not want to answer any questions before his case was   heard.  
 

  Massata Diack also refused to respond directly when quizzed over the payment.   However after confirming the weather was pleasant in Senegal he added: ‚ÄúIt is   better to see you and the French judges your ultimate bosses ‚Äì in courts ‚Äì to   get to the bottom of it!!! The investigation is over and if you are sure of   your proofs, just present them there.‚Äù  
 

  This latest development, coming after the former Uefa president Michel   Platini was arrested as part of a police corruption probe into the awarding   of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, will increase the scrutiny on how the country   has tried to acquire major sporting events.  
 

  Al-Khelaifi and his right-hand man Yousef al-Obaidly, the chief executive of   BeIN Sports, two of the most senior figures in sport, are facing ‚Äúactive   corruption‚Äù charges related to the $3.5m payment. They have been declared   ‚Äúmise en examen‚Äù, which they are now suspects in the case rather than a   witness.  
 

  Al-Khelaifi denies all allegations. Al-Obaidly also denies any suggestion of   corruption. His representatives insist that the $3.5m wire transfers were a   ‚Äúnon-refundable deposit‚Äù by a private company Oryx QSI to Pamodzi Sports   Marketing, owned by the IAAF‚Äôs appointed agent, Massata Diack, and not to   Massata Diack directly. They say this was part of a wider $32.6m bid for   athletics TV rights that was dependent on Qatar winning the rights to hold   the 2017 world championships.  
 

  Nasser Al-Khelaifi was also recently asked in court about his connection to   the bids for the 2017 world athletics championships and the 2020 Olympics. ‚ÄúI   did not deal at all with the negotiations for the World Championships in   Athletics or for the Olympic Games,‚Äù he told the investigating judge, Renaud   van Ruymbeke, in a transcript seen by the Guardian. ‚ÄúFor these events, there   is an organising committee in which I am not a stakeholder.‚Äù  
 

  However several documents sent from the Hotmail address used by Nasser   Al-Khelaifi as part of a previously unreported five-man ‚Äúbrain trust‚Äù \[sic\]   tasked with helping the then crown prince, ‚Äúbrain storm strategies and   coordinate efforts‚Äù to win the 2017 championships and the 2020 Olympics.  
 

  Other emails suggest Al-Khelaifi‚Äôs willingness to use his role as boss of Al   Jazeera Sports ‚Äì which later changed its name to BeIN Sports ‚Äì to help Qatar   win the 2017 World Athletics Championships.  
 

  A confidential letter sent on 26 June 2011 to him by Saoud al-Thani ‚Äì the   general secretary of the Qatari Olympic Committee and chairman of the 2017   World Championships bidding committee ‚Äì asks him to ‚Äúsupport the event‚Äù by   buying the TV rights for the 2017 world athletics championships, as well as   the rights of the other IAAF competitions for 2014-2019.  
 

  A week later, Al-Khelaifi responds that he accepts all the requests, adding   that Al Jazeera Sports ‚Äúis very pleased to be part of the Team of the Doha   2017 IAAF World Championship Bid Committee and working closely toward the   success of this event in Qatar‚Äù.  
 

  Al-Khelaifi did not respond to questions sent by the Guardian and Mediapart.   His lawyer added: ‚ÄúMr Al Khelaifi only answers to the judges. He has nothing   to declare to you and regrets the violation \[of the confidentiality\] of the   probe.‚Äù",Liberal,1561725920,danielle_doll,0,1,True,2019-06-28

New Presidential Poll,"Hello Reddit!

I am looking to make a new poll for the 2020 presidential election. People across all sides of the political spectrums are annoyed with the major polling organisations because they can have special interests, only poll certain people, or do not weight every response the same. While I understand why these organisations weigh age groups according to the previous election demographics there are issues with these polls. A lot of people will look at these polls and believe that say 35% for one candidate means that 35% of Americans want that candidate, it means that 35% of potential voters according to the last elections demographics want that candidate. 

My new poll aims to fix this. I want to get every possible person to answer these polls and make sure that every vote is weighed equally. The best way for this to work is for everyone to answer honestly, share, and answer the poll once.  Thank you in advance, this will be a weekly poll. 

Mine will be run independently, free of influence from companies and other people. If you ever want proof of my results I am always willing to do that. For now the polls are on google but I hope to eventually have a cleaner website.

Why I support Bernie Sanders.,"Establishment centrist run of the mill type politician democrat is the most hated type of democrat by people in the red states so why would we pick that type of candidate to try to get their vote?

Since red states have a lot of poor working class people having a Democrat who wants to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, save them from having to face bankruptcy because they can‚Äôt pay medical bills, not have them live in a dirty polluted environment and give their children taxpayer paid college so they won‚Äôt have to pay for it for the rest of their lives is far better an option to try to get them on our side.

He also is more likely to get people who voted for Trump to vote for him. There are 3 main reasons for this;

1. He doesn‚Äôt automatically see them as bad people. 

He knows very well that there‚Äôs people who voted for Trump simply because they‚Äôre bigots but he also knows that in a system that favors the rich a lot of people would rather choose a human recking ball then someone who would have kept everything the same despite the growing wealth inequality.

2. He doesn‚Äôt just talk the talk on helping working people like Trump no instead he has repeatedly walked the walk and not to mention he talks the talk better too.

He has a history of helping working people he has marched with workers when Trump was feeding his ego with his money and when he‚Äôs talking he always talks about substantive real issues that affect working people.

3. He is willing to go to the other side and tell them his policies that only get popular overtime.

 He had been on Fox News showing his willingness to try to convince others of his beliefs that most if not all centrist Democrats who are running wouldn‚Äôt be willing to speak to.

Now on to the socialist issue. Obama was called a socialist, Hillary Clinton was called a socialist, no matter what we‚Äôre gonna be called socialists and now in 2019 it‚Äôs not as effective to simply call someone a socialist.

The history of calling of a democrat a socialist is a lot like how hearing someone curse is. At the first time it‚Äôs shocking but as you mature it‚Äôs said so much that it gradually loses it‚Äôs taboo and eventually only grandmas are shocked when they hear it.

Family Matters.. how to deal with being the outsider advice request?,"This is incredibly long I‚Äôm so sorry I‚Äôm just at my wits end and need someway to cope with my family‚Äôs political leanings. Mobile user Sorry. TLDR at end. 

I recently graduated undergrad and am living back at home. My mom is American white 13th generation in America and my dad is Chinese 3rd generation. He‚Äôs got old school racism, really classy name calling and Ching Chang and thought he knew Kung fu type racism. When I would visit home from college, I realized my new found political savvy and what I believed was not reflected at home. They are more conservative leaning and I‚Äôm pretty sure he voted for Trump in the last election for his ‚Äòbusiness skills‚Äô whereas I would never vote for Trump because he‚Äôs fundamentally an awful human being and he def doesn‚Äôt have any business skills. 

Anyway... Problem #1. I‚Äôm beginning to think my mom thinks I hate her for being white because my sister and I make a lot of white people jokes or references memes about it since that‚Äôs just popular culture. Dunno what to do about this. 

Problem #2 the other day my dad got mad because a tv show had a scene where a black character got mad at a white character and (I didn‚Äôt see the scene) but hearing their comments made me think the tv show was calling out white privilege as is popular culture. And my dad got mad because it was unnecessarily political and ‚Äúwhy do they have to hate on white people for being white‚Äù. yep. So I jokingly say ‚Äòshut up‚Äô and yes this was wrong because they‚Äôre sensitive. My mom joins in and says hey he experienced racism and if he wants to have his opinion that they shouldn‚Äôt hate on white people then let him. I try to explain that‚Äôs not what the show is probably doing (again I referred to the fact that I didn‚Äôt see the scene) but that it is annoying that that‚Äôs how they perceive it because that means they don‚Äôt really understand the problem and they‚Äôre just trying to be the victims. 

I‚Äôm conflicted and angry because I feel as if their political stances are going against everything I was taught by them to value. Being kind to others and sympathetic and sharing and all that apparent bullshit is just stuff we say to kids and we don‚Äôt actually act on those beliefs. Whereas, I feel as if I actually am embodying those beliefs with my political leanings since I think we should have universal healthcare and higher wages and allll this liberal party beliefs. 

The only saving grace is that they believe in climate change thank god. And vaccines. 

I wish there was someway for them to understand why I lean politically the way I do.

Proud to be an American,"Today is the 4th of July and no matter what social injustices that are happening, I can say that I am proud to be an American. I am lucky to live in the country that I do. A lot of people in this world aren't as fortunate. I'm lucky to have been born in the great USA. 

We haven't always had the freedom we are celebrating today. We came here and slaughtered innocent people for the land we now have. We killed children in order to secure our ""freedom"". But that's not who we are anymore. That's not who the people coming into our country are. The PEOPLE coming into this country aren't trying to kill your children, or ""take"" your jobs. They are seeking freedom, just as we did 400 years ago. 

Not everyone is so lucky. There are people out there suffering, people who dream of finding a better life here. I can only imagine the suffering someone must be going through where they would risk the lives of their family. I mean, I would do anything for mine. I would die for them.

But just because it's the law doesn't mean it's right. Say it with me again, JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE LAW DOESN'T MEAN IT'S RIGHT. I mean we treat our rapists and murderers better than the human beings being held at border camps. 

So let me end with this... Growing up I had a hard time feeling proud to be an American. Mostly because of my race, but at the end of the day our ancestors don't define who we are. YOU define who you are and what you stand for. 

So today and every day I am proud to be an American and to be able to live in this beautiful country that I call home, and I also know that we can do better. We ARE better. I can only dream to live in a world where there are no prejudices, one where we take care of one another, and where we can be comfortable in our own skin.

Capitalism is liberal.,"Capitalism is by definition one of the most liberal concepts we have. It is directly modeled off of evolution. It is evolution applied to economics.

&amp;#x200B;

In it's very nature capitalism is about innovation and new ideas. Capitalism eschews conservatism. If you attempt to artificially conserve an economic system that is the exact opposite of capitalism.

&amp;#x200B;

Bailing out a failing company is the antitheses of capitalism. It would be the same as saving a species that was supposed to die. That is the nature and essence of capitalism and evolution. Things are supposed to die and in their failures we will find a better solution. Businesses and life.

&amp;#x200B;

We can also agree it's in everyone's best interest to remove capitalism from the healthcare system. You can remove the profiteering from healthcare without compromising the rest of the system.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we should be arguing that liberals are the true capitalists. We just understand that capitalism doesn't need to be applied to everything.

"What should we focus on *More*, homicides or suicides in the US?","So obviously gun deaths have been on the rise and this is a tricky subject for a lot of people. I‚Äôve read all arguments, both left and right and in between. I‚Äôve read banning them entirely, and the consequences of that, and I‚Äôve also read actually making guns easier to get and consequences of that. 

It got me interested so I looked it up. Now what I‚Äôm stating is all factual and I don‚Äôt mean to ruffle any feathers. It‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve come across. So it seems that Brazil actually has more gun deaths than the United States by a few thousand. That is as of 2016 (https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-states-and-brazil-top-list-nations-most-gun-deaths). Nearly 90% of their gun deaths are homicide. Then I looked at the US and saw over half of our gun deaths are suicide. And also 80% of the homicides are gang or drug related. This means that only about 10% of all gun deaths are actual murders (I know drug and gang killings are murders, but I mean just civilian killing civilian). So I started wondering if the whole mental health argument was true. I mean I didn‚Äôt expect suicide numbers to be that high. About 60% of all gun deaths?? Brazil on the other hand had only 5-8% suicides accounting for gun deaths. 

So the more I looked at it, the more it seemed that Brazil actually had a murder problem. It looks like we kinda just have a mental health problem more than anything. Do you think we could help stop all the shootings and deaths by focusing on mental health? It may stop both the suicides and the killers. And as for the drug and gang violence I think that all falls on the war on drugs. Because Brazil banned guns in 2002 and even after that it saw a continuous rise in gun deaths (murders). 

Obviously I‚Äôm on the side of wanting less deaths here. I know some of my points come across somewhat right leaning but they‚Äôre just me noticing how large the gap is between Brazil and the US and how many suicides we have in comparison to non drug related murders.",Liberal,1563382451,qdolobp,0,1,True,2019-07-17

This scares me SO much because this is a member of a group within the Democratic Party vying for the influence to drive the policies of the future within the party admitting that diversity acts as  labels and they only exist and are okay if you think the same as the rest of the group.

Groupthink is terrible. Groupthink rises to tyrannical regimes. We‚Äôre better than that in this country.

Is this REALLY the direction that we want the future of our country to go in? Can we not be better? Or is groupthink the future? And anyone that thinks differently than the rest will be marginalized and persecuted regardless of how they look? 

Is this not dangerous? I mean at least the party that‚Äôs not in power in our country has access and voice and representation, regardless of how much disagreement there is.

"About the use of the term ""Liberal"" and addressing all Democrats as ""Liberals""","What do you think about it? Especially what do you think about ""Liberal"" and ""Liberalism"" being used so freely, thus many times incorrectly? 

US has only two big parties, therefore almost everyone is labeled either a ""Liberal"" or a ""Conservative"", which isnt really good because both parties are big tent, plus this created a bad name for Liberalism. Nowadays if you say ""Liberalism"" (Even in Europe at this point) people dont know what you mean, because it has been used (incorrectly) by many people whose views arent actually Liberal.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that both parties should either use their very own labels ""Democrat"" and ""Republican"".  I think Democrats nowadays are ideologically Progressive to Progressive Conservative with all sort of economical ideologies - from neoliberalism to social democracy and even socialism.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now let me explain what I meant by ""Progressive Conservative"":**

Conservatism is (according to the ideological definition) always fundamentally skeptical of the individual and his ability to have a  ""healthy"" behavior. Thus conservatives limit the individual because of  moral or hierarchical reasons. 

Progressivim limits the individuals to create a more equal society, they're willing to disregard rights and give plethora of advantages to the ""disadvantaged"" to make the ""game fair"", they are essentially like Social Democrats, except the ideology is more socially oriented, rather than economically. They justify their actions with extensive Positive rights and usually find it immoral to have someone be ""Oppresed""

This is taken directly from this imgur post, with pictures [here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/M9tJgiU)

TLDR; the genetic code exists in 2 languages and 2 dialects

**Chapter 1: DNA**

If we think of the genetic code as a language; which is largely how it behaves; human biology possess 2 languages, and 2 different dialects.

There exists the code that resides in the DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic acid. This is a long molecule that is composed of a sugar phosphate backbone. Attached to the backbone is any of 4 nitrogenous bases composed of adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). This establishes one language; the ""nucleic"" language.

**Chapter 2: RNA**

The sequence from the DNA is copied into another long molecule; a ribonucleic acid, or RNA. This is essentially the same molecule; however, the sugar contains an extra oxygen atom, and as a result, it uses a uracil (U) instead of a thymine (T). This is represented as a separate dialect from the ""deoxy"" dialect. It carries the exact same sequence in the same language, just with a different letter. The ""Ribo"" dialect.

**Chapter 3: Peptides**

Upon processing of the RNA into a messenger RNA; or mRNA; it is taken to a ribosome. This is a molecular machine that reads the mRNA sequence and brings another RNA molecule; a transfer RNA or tRNA; in proximity to it. Each tRNA maintains two aspects; it binds an amino acid, and it contains a specific 3 base sequence that is to be a mirror match of that sequence on mRNA. The tRNA is structured perfectly for the ribosome to gather the proper tRNA, so that the proper amino acids are put close enough to react and create a peptide bond. The result is a polypeptide that forms a functional protein once it is folded into the proper 3D configuration. This scientific term for this process is literally translation. This establishes the second language; the ""peptide"" language, distinct from the ""nucleic"" language.

**Chapter 4: Proteins**

Alas! We have the proverbial Rosetta Stone! Pictured above (source at bottom) is the nucleic codon to amino acid conversion chart. 

The peptide language consists of 20 letters (Source for the amino acids below). With codons 3 bases long, each amino acid is associated with atleast one sequence including 3 codons telling the ribosome to stop, and one (Met, or methionine) that additionally functions to start translation. 

This polypeptide ""word"" then takes on a structure that allows it to perform a certain function, such as a molecular gateway in the membrane that only allows certain particles to pass (extremely useful in neurophysiology), or a hormone, like insulin. 

Proteins must fold specifically to be functional. Local interactions are due to adjacent amino acids; for example, bases that are hydrophobic (repel water) will form a coil, or an alpha helix. These local interactions are the result of the sequence. These interactions play a crucial role in function; however, they do not exhaustive make a function protein. Another layer of folding is required; tertiary structure. This a more complicated set of folding, and often requires the aid of other proteins, such as chaperones. 

Some proteins also take on quaternary structure, which means that separate polypeptide strings must be folded together in order for function. An example of this is hemoglobin with contains 4 parts. 

It is interesting to note that it is estimated that for every polypeptide sequence that is 250 amino acids long (rather short for a protein; human RNA polymerase is ~37,000 amino acids long), only 1 of those sequences elicits a functional protein in every 10^77  sequences (source provided below).

Ilhan Omar refuses to condemn female genital mutilation. Labels the question as ‚Äúappalling‚Äù.,"Recently,  congresswoman Ilhan Omar was asked to condemn female genital mutilation while at the Muslim Caucus Education Collective‚Äôs 2019 Conference.

Reasons I will be voting for Bernie Sanders in 2020,"Bernie Sanders should get the Democrat party‚Äôs nomination for the 2020 election, but if he doesn‚Äôt these are the reasons I will still be voting for him.

1. Bernie‚Äôs idea of free college is amazing, because it will create more jobs for the future. Think about it if we have more college graduates there will also be more jobs available. We will also have a better economy because of all the degrees people will be getting. 

2. Minimum Wage needs to be raised to at least $17 an hour, if we raise the minimum wage enough, no one will be poor ever again. Think about it, if we have a high minimum wage we can all have a bunch of money and boost the economy by spending it.

3.  Everyone has a right to health care, if everyone has free health care no one will have to pay a dime for it ever again and, you could go to the doctor whenever you want free of charge. Think about it, if we don‚Äôt have to pay for healthcare we could all go to the E.R. whenever we want without the fear of a bill showing up that‚Äôs charging us thousands for health care, a universal right for God‚Äôs sake!",Liberal,1557292790,Bambino16,6,4,True,2019-05-08

Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid,"This is going around so I thought I would share it here                                                                      Authors name at the bottom       

An anguished question from a Trump supporter: ""Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?""

The serious answer: Here‚Äôs what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don't...

That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought ""Fine.""

That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, ""Okay.""

That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, ""No problem.""

That when he made up stories about seeing muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, ""Not an issue.""

That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, ""He sure knows me.""

That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, ""That's cool!""

That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw.

That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, ""Well, who has time?""

That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, ""That makes sense.""

That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, ""Yes!""

That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, ""What a great guy!""

That you have watched the parade of neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, ""Thumbs up!""

That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, ""That's the way I want my President to be.""

That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, ""What a genius!""

That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, ""That's smart!""

That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, ""That makes sense.""

That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, ""falling in love"" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, ""That's statesmanship!""

That Trump separated children from their families and put them in cages, managed to lose track of 1500 kids. has opened a tent city incarceration camp in the desert in Texas - he explains that they‚Äôre just ‚Äúanimals‚Äù - and you say, ‚Äúwell, ok then.‚Äù

That you have witnessed all the thousand and one other manifestations of corruption and low moral character and outright animalistic rudeness and contempt for you, the working American voter, and you still show up grinning and wearing your MAGA hats and threatening to beat up anybody who says otherwise.

What you don't get, Trump supporters in 2019, is that succumbing to frustration and thinking of you as stupid may be wrong and unhelpful, but it's also...hear me...charitable.

Because if you're NOT stupid, we must turn to other explanations, and most of them are less flattering.

New Member,"Hello all,

I am new to this subreddit (and reddit in general) and, in wake of so many states outlawing abortion, want to remind people Plan B does not need a prescription and if you can get a prescription it is covered at least partially on most insurances. You can get it from the pharmacy and if they have it in stock they will sell it to you no questions asked. For people wanting to help, stocking up on Plan B and mailing it to someone who cannot get one (whether for monetary reason or legal reasons), although not particularly legal, is hard for law enforcement to enforce and with modern technology, is pretty easy to achieve. Feel free to DM me with any questions.

The Final Word on Abortion,"Do you Christian people understand that there are innumerable people who consider your sky-king to be plain old common garden-variety mythology?  (in fact, you are far outnumbered.)   Yep, just like you look at the deities of other cultures far older than yours: as a sort of an amusing fairy tale. A made-up imaginary guy in hopelessly outdated clothing, who people used to believe in, back in the olden days. 

Do you acknowledge that all these living (sacred!) human beings' feelings about your mythology are every bit as valid, as your feelings about their ""mythology?"" None of you have any more proof than anyone else.

Do you realize that you are attempting to boss around the whole entire world with your imaginary mythology?  (literally. America has withdrawn funding from family planning organizations worldwide which include abortion services.)

Do you acknowledge that no deity or saint has ever straight-up appeared to you on a flaming cloud and told you, or anyone, clearly and in no uncertain terms, that an almost microscopic bunch of human cells are a sacred living human being which must be forced into birth at all costs -- despite the fact that Nature, which your sky-king also supposedly created, routinely expels these bunches of cells naturally from a woman's body for no reason at all at least 20% of the time anyway?  You can't tell me that your sky-king doesn't know that it happens constantly and always has.

Do you understand how ridiculous it sounds to propose that an ovum, which women discharge from their bodies and throw away every month of their life for decades, in a process which men mostly regard with disgust and horror; and a sperm cell, which men discharge from their bodies and throw away possibly every single day for decades (and whatever they wipe it up with is so disdained that the term for it is used as a pejorative for a woman that a man deems to be of loose morals) ---  to propose that these two microscopic bits of common bodily effluvia, each of them separately something to be mopped up and flushed down the toilet -- if they happen to be in the same place at one time, then literally ONE SECOND LATER they have become a precious sacred living human being with a ""soul"" and hopes and fears and full legal rights and a frickin Social Security number?

We cannot support the vast increase in rent-seeking behavior,"Among economists, ""rent-seeking behavior"" is when someone seeks to get payments from you at regular intervals. The most common form of this is from landlords. They would charge you twice a month if they could; since they can't, they simply charge you as much as you can possibly afford. There is no rational reason for rents to be as high as they are, while wages are so low. Rent is supposed to be around 30% of your income.


Meanwhile, many other providers of goods and services have laid aside the notion of selling you something once in favor of selling it to you over and over, month after month. Or even, god help us, selling it to you once AND renting it to you thereafter. 


Television used to be free, paid for by a few minutes of commercials per hour. Then cable came along, promising to do away with those annoying commercials for a monthly fee. That was cool for awhile, then the cable companies got greedy and the commercials started creeping in again. Now they have you paying a ridiculous amount of money and there are more commercials than ever before. The programs, meanwhile, are fluffed out so badly that the ratio of actual content to time spent watching is pathetic.


So then you get the streaming services. That was cool for awhile; then other content providers that used to be free start seeking rent too. Meanwhile, all the streaming services start offering less and less of any real value to see how little they can offer you and still get that monthly rent.  So now we pay for Netflix, Hulu, Prime, and there's still barely anything good on.  Those few shows that are good are only making ten shows A YEAR. 


Then you have your electric bill, water bill (landlords used to pay that), ISP payment, phone bill, car payment, car insurance payment, health insurance payment, childcare, grocery bills, student loan payments, and who knows what else.


Software that you used to simply buy and use, is now kept in the cloud and charges monthly rent. Amazon has just made a deal with Apple not to sell iPhones refurbished by anyone except for licensed Apple dealers/refurbishers.


We are fighting to raise the minimum wage to $15, and they are actually fighting back! $15 is already inadequate in the states where it's been passed; by the time it's the minimum wage everywhere, it will be laughably far away from anything like a living wage. Meanwhile, these unbearably greedy corporations -- the same ones that will not pay us a living wage -- hardly even pay any taxes.

"Trump isn't that bad you're just a bunch of communist libtards, who think it's the guns that kill, but still support the murder of innocent children before they can even experience life for themselves."," you talk about how it's your body your choice but you never think about the soul you created, it has rights too. Maybe you could take responsibility for not using protection, or at least consider adoption. If you were raped you can always turn to adoption. Now guns, they were originally made for war, but they never killed, it was the people behind the trigger that killed. Now in these times guns are for self defense and hunting. Many soldiers risk their lives using guns defending your right to murder children. Then many hunt to keep food on the table and support a family. If you want to be mad at guns, don't, you support the legal murder of children but don't want people to defend themselves. Cops, they aren't ruthless racist murderers, most fear for their safety and want to defend others, they are the reason you can walk down the street and not look over your shoulder, when they do kill no one cares if they kill a white man woman or child but if they were black it would be all over the news. Look at both sides of the story before hating on anyone. Let's talk about your socialist ideas. Let's talk about communism, basicly everything is free, you think it hasn't been hasn't been tried, but it has, and has failed, the only reason communist countries work is if they reform their economic system to match capitalist systems, not to mention many have died from communism. Because everything is distributed equally people will not receive enough to live and it will inevitably fail. Your ideas  of gender can be odd. Now if your trans and are actually trans and don't want attention, your fine, I am perfectly fine with people who actually are trans or gay or lesbian. If you do it to stand out for attention then you are not only making a actual issue laughable and less credible, but you also most likely have self esteem issues. When you start making a list of different genders you are seeming like a joke and not the funny kind, the kind the attention seeker in class would tell out loud. If we are going through this much trouble and are complaining about how their isn't a bathroom for every gender, although it isn't as big as it was a few years ago, we can just switch it  from boy girl to penis and no penis. You're a man but you don't  have a penis so go in the no penis room your a woman but you're trans so you have a penis go in the penis room. Every one has an opinion, some options can be shot down like your views on abortion, cops, and government.

Globalism is Anglo Saxon ethnocentrism and Liberalism is a cancer for this world,"Examples of Anglo Saxon virtues, that developed locally and are adaptive to Anglo Saxons first and foremost, but Anglo Saxons yet want to export into the whole world are: Free markets, democracy, parlamentarism, multiculturalism, feminism, unhinged technological change, scientism, separation of religion and state, human rights, gay rights

The liberals of today who think they need to liberate the third world from religious fundamentalism, who think Russia needs to be liberated by an undemocratic homophob dictator are the same kind of people psychologically speaking as the Anglo Saxon colonialists who travaled to Africa during colonial times and when encountering the native people thought these Africans are dumb underdeveloped savages that need Jesus, a sewage system and ought to be ridded of their tribal beliefs and customs. The white man's burden, precisely.

White liberals think of non-western people as undeveloped savages who are still closer to the animals, intellectually and morally inferior children, and it's the moral duty of the western liberals people to pass down their superior culture. 

Studies have shown that liberals change their style of language when talking to non-white people, they essentially dumb down, like adults do with children. Conservatives, however make no difference when talking to people about the race of the people they talk to.

I would assume many American liberals empathize with the various Native American tribes that were displaced during the settling of the New World. I'm sure no liberal would say the Native Americans were wrong to resist encroachment by Europeans onto their land. At the same time, many liberals/progressives are seemingly okay with traditionally European homelands and cities (specifically England as we are speaking English currently) being inundated by ethnic minorities. The excuse is usually that it's different because it's legal immigration and they arent coming there to genocide white people. Another excuse is that the people immigrating are subjects of former colonies and it's only right for them to be allowed. Regardless of the reasoning, wouldn't the end result of all this immigration be similar to what has happened in many south American countries? There will be barely any original Natives left, their culture will be weakened and a majority of the population will be some combination of 2 or more ethnic groups.

Pro gun. I believe that people have the right to defend themselves. Simple as that. And 97 percent of mass shootings take place in gun free zones. 3 million people are saved every year by guns, versus 30 thousand dead. Meaning you are 93 times more likely to be saved by a gun.

Pro life. As a society, it is our job to speak for those with no voice. Those who are marginalized. And nobody is marginalized more than the unborn. Life begins at conception. No circumstances (other than the life of the mother being at risk) makes the life of the baby less valuable. 

Immigration: I am totally for immigration. But it has to be legal. There is a process. I do think it should be easier to immigrate, but that does not justify breaking the law. Illegal immigrants should be deported.

Israel: the Jewish people have lived there forever, and Israel has a right to exist. It is okay to criticize the Israeli government. But not to say anything about how the Jewish people are responsible for the actions of the government, or its because they are Jewish that these things happen.

White/male privilege: doesn‚Äôt exist. There are no rights not afforded to whites/males not afforded to any other group. If there is, I will stand with you and say it is unjust. But it doesn‚Äôt exist

Free speech/religion you have the right to say whatever you want no matter how hateful, unless you directly say something like ‚Äúgo kill _____‚Äù  and you have the freedom to exercise your religion in whatever way shape or form you desire as long it it does not harm the physical well being/infringe on the property rights of others.

When I look at the campaign for the democrats running in 2020, a lot of them seem to be completely focused around Donald Trump. They say things about how he needs to be defeated in 2020 and how the candidate will do just that, but why aren't they more focused on policy rather than simply defeating the opposition? Even if you look through this subreddit, there are relatively a lot of posts that have to do with Donald Trump rather than things about democratic party and its candidates.

I am right leaning and I want opinions from the other side.,"To start off I did see another post the other day on this Sub Reddit and this will have a similar premise. But I more want to know what a someone on the left believes, and more specifically why they believe it.  So I am gonna go through a few points that I'm curious about, and explain my view points on them.

I also want to point out because I've never gotten an opinion from a liberal I may not completely understand some points, and I would like if you can explain certain things in more detail. Every time I see something online about liberals it is always a radical liberal, and I want opinions from a more moderate group, radicals on both sides should never be considered what they all are. For example my friend hates liberals because all he ever sees are these radical liberals on the internet(Hes also a radical conservative). I want to show me, and even him that not every person leaning towards the left is like that.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Religion:\*\* The reason I chose this first is because I'm sure most people here can agree with me on this. I believe that religion should stay out of politics. I do not believe that people should have to conform to one persons religions just because, and this is coming from a religious man. I believe basing ones politics on religion is the wrong way to go with this country, and laws should based on science, again this is coming from a Christian  man.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2nd Amendment:\*\* I would like to know your opinion on guns, and gun control. As well as why you believe what you do. I personally believe that gun control should be reformed, not to be stricter but to just be better(idk how to put that). And for ownership of guns themselves, I believe if you can past a more reformed gun control test then I believe you should only be allowed to carry a PISTOL out in public, and any other gun you own should only  be allowed at gun ranges, and inside your house. I also believe that you should be allowed to defend yourself and others using said gun.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Abortion:\*\* I would like to know your guys takes on abortion. My opinion is that you should be allowed to abort the baby until it is considered alive \*\*BY A SCIENTIST\*\* and I do not think religion should take any part in the law of this. Especially this new case going to the supreme court, I expect the supreme court to uphold Roe V Wade. Now I also want to state I morally do not condone abortion, and would not do it myself, but I do not believe my moral belief in this case should be enforced on others.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Harassment:\*\* I want to know your guys opinions on the definition of harassment. I personally believe harassment is when you repeatedly say or do something after being told not to do said thing by the one you are doing it to. I do not believe calling a woman ""sexy"" should be considered harassment unless it is repeated, in that case I agree it should be considered harassment. (Sexual harassment is different, touching a woman sexually without their consent is just wrong in every way).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*White/Male Privilege:\*\* I want to know the definition of this word from a left leaner. I personally believe that oppression has dramatically decreased in the U.S. And I believe it is unjust to tell white people or men that they have a privilege among all others. It simply makes people think they have an unfair advantage and it just puts them down. I agree that everyone should have equal rights, including during Marshall Law. I know many here will disagree with me on this opinion but I believe this to be wholeheartedly true.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Hate Speech:\*\* I want to know what you guys consider hate speech. Personally I don't believe in hate speech, this also doesn't mean I condone or agree with rude obnoxious people. I believe they should be called out. I should clarify I more or less don't believe so called hate speech should be illegal. I believe in the 1st amendment and think that is one of the things that makes America stand out compared to countries such as Canada, or England, or really any other country(We are the only country that has true free speech).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*If you want to know my opinion on anything else just ask and I'll let you know. These are all opinions from a moderate right leaner.\*\*

Have any free speech supporters actually used free speech publicly? Esp those upset with Pope Francis's comment? Don't they realize even the average Joe can get violent over things they don't like to hear (esp involving sacred cows and self-esteem)?,"I should have signed up on reddit and make a comment about it when Pope Francis made it years ago but oh well better late than never.

Several years ago, people were getting quite angry when Pope Francis made a comment right after the Charlie Hedbo incident. He used an example that if a friend insulted his mother, he CANNOT expect the Pope himself to just stand there and take it and it shouldn't be surprising if Francis decides to punch him. Basically the Pope was saying words you say have consequences and esp when it involves something as sensitive as religion, you shouldn't be surprised at the possibility of violence breaking out. 

People thought he was defending the Charlie Hedbo killings. Honestly I was flabbergasted they missed his point. The accusations on the Pope being a supporter of the Charlie Hedbo terrorism and even supporting ISIS and anti-Americanism (and similar comments of that nature) got so ridiculous that the Pope had to make a comment stating that he completely condemns the Charlie Hedbo attack and he completely defends freedom of speech. That people are missing his point (which is expecting painful repercussion INCLUDING physical violence).

Even after that plenty of people esp from Anglo Saxon countries in particular Canada and America still expressed outrage at Pope Francis and were stating the Pope is full of **** because free speech means anyone has the right to say anything...............

So I have to ask HAVE any of these commentators- esp on the internet- ever tried to go into a biker bar and yell out that Hell's Angels are  a bunch of P*****s  fags? Or tried to debate with a redneck from Oklahoma? 

I state that because when I was younger I used to love debating about various topics from religion to dinosaurs and politics. Not only would plenty of debates I took part of get so of course with the other side doing personal attacks and using fallacies....... But no matter how much I tried to be polite and use logic often physical stuff would get involved. In fact as early as 10 seconds into a debate just starting, when I would point out inconsistencies and other flawed logic when it comes to sacred cow subjects like military spending, already I got blitzed and punched. This happened too many times I decided to just avoid religion and sensitive subjects.

But even than I'd learn humans would get so damn rude and depending on how long I insisted on the argument and the flow of it, I'd get punched over stuff as snicker bar. One time I was pointing out why Transformers as a franchise had plenty of flaws but the Transformers fanboy wouldn't listen and was getting pissed. He than brought comment out that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (which I publicly expressed was my favorite movie at the time) is a stupid Arab, and Arabs look stupid and he literally said ""thats what you look like-stupid!""

I was so pissed because not only is Lawrence of Arabia ABOUT A blonde blue eyed British soldier (and the guy never watched the movie) but WHAT THE **** does Arabs have to do with the debate (which was about Transformers?!!!!)? On top of that I was not an Arab and I was white looking and in addition....... Even if you were losing an argument or couldn't come up with a debate........... That DOESN'T JUSTIFY RACIST ATTACKS esp COMMENTS! 

Luckily this never got physical but I was so shocked because of all things to get VERBALLY AGGRESSIVE about, a Hasbro Toyline and TV cartoon? And to even bring up OFF-TOPIC racial comments including making a completely inaccurate comment attacking a movie hero as with a racist comment towards nonwhite (DESPITE the fact they never watched it because if they did they'd KNOW the leading role is a blonde blue eyed Englishman?!)?!

I could not believe it! But I'd learn even making comments about stuff thats objective with solid evidence could lead to violence. I remember when I was pointing out to a Filipino that Manny the Pac-Man flat out lost a recent fight because he was injured prior to the bout and he wasn't in his best shape (along with his opponent being taller and heavier), I was suddenly punched out of nowhere. I could not believe it because I was a BIG PAC-MAN myself!!!! And boxing isn't exactly a Biblical thing concerning God's commandments right? Nor does it involve Republicans and Democrats? Hell the simple fact Manny lost the fight in a lopsided match and was knocked down several times (almost losing to a TKO in an early round) is ALREADY enough objective proof. Hell Pac-Man himself said on public TV after the fight he should have not slacked off conditioning months prior!

This was the biggest shock because not only did the celebrity this Filipino claimed to be a ""true fan of"" supported my views but it was an outright objective one. The results proved it, various referees and experts across the boxing industry agreed, Manny's coach was criticizing him publicly for his incompetence, and even international news including Filipino TV and a good number of his fans were saying Manny had no chance. So to get HIT really ROCKED my world so much......... 

I gave up on free speech that day. Don't get me started on a thing I saw at a bar months later where two people were arguing over what music to play. One of them ultimately USED his own money to insert into the juke box and the other person suckerpunched him........... And this isn't even about free speech at all technically!

So I have to ask............. People so insistent on their right to speech..... In particular those who were outraged at Pope Francis's comments about expecting a punch for making a ""yo mama"" comment...........

 Do they have any experience in the real world? Have any of them ever tried to burn the Bible in front of a Church or write an article about revealing the recent theft a local bully has done? Have any of them even tried to debate at a bar politely about trivial stuff?

Because honestly as someone who experienced verbal insults and even physical assaults for politely debating, I am just baffled how naive so many people can be esp on reddit and other website in regards to free speech. Esp about Pope Francis's statement (which is just ****ing common sense!)!

I know this comes off as a rant but I had to post it because its as though many people in the modern day West expects people to send them flowers for burning the Torah. I got insulted (often with off-topic bigoted stuff such as racist slurs like white trash) for far less, for stuff as trivia as the Transformer toys and the Bionicle franchise (despite not even arguing but just debating politely and pointing out real flaws quite often I'm even a big fan of said subject such as Randy Couture and am merely pointing out his slip ups!).

I'll leave it here because I'll go on and on about very bad and even traumatizing memories.

California giving healthcare to Undocumented Immigrants,"Source here:

(Universal healthcare supporter here) My take: This is a bad fucking idea. Politicians and people in Jail get free healthcare. Now up to 100,000 undocumented immigrants get free healthcare

The only people not getting free healthcare are the people who pay taxes. That means everyone who actually pays taxes into the system doesn‚Äôt get free healthcare and in fact pays for everyone‚Äôs healthcare. 

This is also a state with some of the highest tax rates in the nation. This is ridiculous. 

Liberals (including me) have been wanting universal healthcare for decades yet the only people who aren‚Äôt getting it are the people who vote to be represented. Everyone but the constituents are getting what they want. 

We put these fucking people in office to advocate for universal healthcare. They should fucking do it or get out. That would cover everybody. The last thing anyone wanted was for the taxpaying American to be the only one without the benefits we voted for. 

Come on. It‚Äôs not a step in the right direction. It‚Äôs just a way to try and lower ER visits and costs. 

I want everyone to have access to good healthcare regardless of status. But fucking hell this is only for money and it just puts more stress on the people who pay taxes.

"Trump's ""Collusion"" is Peanuts Next to All-But-Forgotten Iran-Contra","(This is not a copy/paste)

&amp;#x200B;

""What has been will be again,

what has been done will be done again;

there is nothing new under the sun.""

Ecclesiastes 1:9

&amp;#x200B;

On inauguration day, 1981, Iran released American hostages captured over a year earlier from the US embassy during the Iranian Revolution. The outgoing president, Jimmy Carter, did everything in his power to free those hostages: from diplomacy; to CIA operations; to commando raids; and finally by negotiating the Algiers Accords. Unfortunately for his reelection campaign, few fruits of these efforts ever manifested during his own term. And yet conveniently for Ronald Reagan, his inauguration coincided with the liberation of all remaining hostages. It was as if, just by entering office, he had so impressed Iran that they released the captives without his having to lift a finger.

&amp;#x200B;

If that sounds fishy to you, you're not alone. It sounded fishy to former Ford/Carter NSC member Gary Sick, whom Reagan fired soon after becoming president. Sick wrote an [Op-Ed](https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_cr/h920205-october-clips.htm) about it in 1991. Abolhassan Banisadr, the president of Iran during that exact period of time, has also [claimed](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/07/world/bani-sadr-in-us-renews-charges-of-1980-deal.html) that Reagan traded his election for weapons to Iran .

&amp;#x200B;

But before you jump the gun, know that there were not one but two congressional investigations of this issue. The first one was arguably not very thorough, but the [second](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/13/us/house-inquiry-finds-no-evidence-of-deal-on-hostages-in-1980.html) one interviewed over 240 people and cost a whopping $1.35 Million‚Äî2.4 Million in today's dollars. Both concluded the same thing, though: no evidence of collusion.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, let's get back to what we do know for sure. In September of 1980, as the US election was nearing its climax, [Iran was invaded by Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War). Carter had placed [sanctions](https://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/us-sanctions), including an arms embargo, on the nascent government back when they took US hostages in 1979, and Reagan kept the embargo going. This embargo, alongside conflict with Iraq, and an ongoing policy of [aiding radical Pro-Shia](https://www.lawfareblog.com/iranian-revolution-and-its-legacy-terrorism) terrorist groups, seriously threatened Iran's logistical war-making-capacity‚Äîwhich is to say, Iran was running out of useful stuff to shoot with. It didn't help that they were fighting against a ruthless guy named Saddam Hussein who, not surprisingly for any student of US foreign policy, was being [assisted by the United States](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/). Iran was desperate for arms relief, from whoever would offer it.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap: when Reagan took office, the Iranian government had instigated an assault on Tehran's US embassy, captured all of the diplomats, and held them hostage for over a year, while going on to wage war against what was at the time a regional ally of the United States. Any weapons they got their hands on were also likely to fall into the hands of terrorists, with whom the Iranian government eagerly affiliated to launch proxy wars. It's not a stretch to say that Iran could be described as an ""enemy of the American people"". At the very least Reagan declared Iran a [State Sponsor of Terrorism](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/state-sponsors-iran) in Jan 1984.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet soon after taking office, Israeli officials later claimed that Reagan facilitated [illegal shipments of American-made weapons into Iran via Israel](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/iran-pipeline-hidden-chapter-special-report-us-said-have-allowed-israel-sell.html). Ostensibly he and Israel were supplying a ""moderate"" Iranian faction in the hopes of a coup against the country's Anti-American wing when the Ayatollah died in the future, but an independent counsel, Lawrence Walsh (a Republican) [determined](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/part_i.htm) that arms were funneled to the government of Iran itself, controlled by the Ayatollah, who was decidedly immoderate, and for the time being very much alive. [Walsh's report](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/), incidentally, is an eye-opeing read that makes Mueller's report look like a glowing Fox fluff piece in comparison. According to the most reasonable [speculation](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/iran-pipeline-hidden-chapter-special-report-us-said-have-allowed-israel-sell.html), Israel's likely motivation was to encourage the US to arm both sides of the war, keeping both countries occupied with each other and off its own back. However, during this time there was no good rationale known to justify the US authorizing such a reckless transfer.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1985 Reagan's official paper trail of selling arms to Iran began (beyond testimony by Israeli officials). This was the same year he began [Operation Staunch](http://www.iran.org/tib/krt/fanning_ch7.htm)‚Äîa global initiative to halt arm sales to Iran, in which US diplomats allegedly scolded host countries over the moral failings of arming Iran. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 1985 we also have the details of his first (or second, depending upon what you believe) trade of arms for US hostages. This time it was Hezbollah who had captured Americans, under the guise of numerous other names, in [1984](https://www.umbc.edu/che/tahlessons/pdf/historylabs/Oliver_North_an_faculty:RS13.pdf). Iran facilitated the release of a few of these prisoners, and in return got a few thousand TOW missiles shipped to them over the following [years](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/part_i.htm), again, an illegal act which violated the US embargo. The hostage rescues came sporadically, but the shipments didn't end until the scandal blew open in late 1986.

&amp;#x200B;

""We were not trading arms for hostages, nor were we negotiating with terrorists"" Reagan later insisted. And yet according to remembered cabinet memos (many of which were destroyed‚Äîmore on that later), by December 1985 at the latest, Reagan's advisers, including Caspar Weinberger (Secretary of Defense), and Don Regan (Secretary of the treasury and mastermind behind ""Reaganomics,"") were telling the president that these acts were illegal, and urged him to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Reagan claimed publicly that the rationale behind this weapons deal was really to arm that mythical pro-US coup of Iranian moderates, but to the [Tower Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Commission) he admitted the weapons were [traded for the hostages](https://books.google.com/books?id=c12BQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781565840478&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijnbyvqOfiAhWCu54KHfTMB_oQ6AEIKjAA). Neither story holds water, as unrecorded weapon shipments to Iran predated any hostage-taking by Hezbollah, and some recorded shipments were made without a direct correlation to any hostages being returned‚Äîand as pointed out before in the Walsh report, the Israeli hand-offs were effectively made to the state of Ayatollah-controlled Iran. Meanwhile, the alleged targets of this strategic, covert, moderate-arming campaign changed from moderate ""political factions,"" to ""army captains,"" to ""government operatives within Iran.""

&amp;#x200B;

By now the parallels between Iran-Contra and Russiagate should be pretty obvious. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, without even mentioning anything about the *Contra* half of the Iran-Contra Affair.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet despite numerous investigations, subpeonas, and indictments, Reagan emerged unscathed and unimpeached. So, too, did many of his [co-conspirators](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963668,00.html), most of whom received [pardons](https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm) , [immunity](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/12/opinion/the-price-of-iran-contra-immunity.html) , or had sentences overturned on [appeal](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/951/369/257995/), including Oliver North (NSC member), who was indicted for obstruction of a congressional inquiry and destruction of documents along with John Poindexter (Nat'l Sec. Adviser) who was convicted of five counts of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, perjury, defrauding the government, and the alteration and destruction of evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

""...One of the most important items of new evidence to emerge from the trial was North's eyewitness description of Poindexter's destruction of the presidential covert-action Finding authorizing the November 1985 \[Iranian Weapon\] shipment"" wrote Walsh in his [report](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/chap_02.htm), describing Reagan's signed authorization of the weapons deal, destroyed in order to protect the president. But Reagan came out, gave a [speech](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/05/us/reagan-white-house-transcript-reagan-s-speech-take-full-responsibilty-for-my.html), and within a couple of decades was ensconced as a hero. Thus we return to today, and to those arguing that not impeaching Trump would somehow be a precedent for presidential misconduct.

&amp;#x200B;

Honey, that ship sailed a long time ago. The office of the president is already corrupted, and our elections are already [rigged](https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com/eip-blogs/2017/1/7/its-even-worse-than-the-news-about-north-carolina-american-elections-rank-last-among-all-western-democracies). 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, Trump is almost certainly a criminal, with [emoluments violations](http://fortune.com/2019/04/30/trumps-emoluments-lawsuit/), [insurance fraud](https://apnews.com/1fefeef4a4e84fa4af6441f4b6d221f0), and [campaign finance violations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/07/government-implicates-trump-trump-campaign-federal-campaign-finance-law-violations/?utm_term=.55aeefc72537) likely under his belt, at least. But he's just another crook in an office with a long history of criminality. From Reagan's Iran-Contra collusion to Bush's WMD [lies](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/20/18274228/ari-fleischer-iraq-lies-george-w-bush-wmds), and Obama's [extrajudicial execution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/legal-memo-backing-drone-strike-is-released/2014/06/23/1f48dd16-faec-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html?utm_term=.0283d53862a7) of the al-Awlakis (something Trump hasn't yet replicated but now has the precedent to do, thanks Obama), Trump is only dangerous because he rests on the precedents set by short-sighted men seizing short-term gains under the auspices of executive privilege. Without correcting that, first and foremost, Trump's removal will mean absolutely nothing. Trump is the gangrene that has set into a sucking chest wound, and acting like some antibiotic alone is going to be a solution without focusing at least as much on essential surgery, at best, naive.

One more strange line of continuity exists between Reagan and Trump. Elliott Abrams, one of the men responsible for the Contra side of the Iran-Contra affair, and whom Ilhan Omar famously [excoriated](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/02/13/rep_ilhan_omar_challenges_venezuela_envoy_elliott_abrams_about_iran-contra_past.html) over his involvement, is back. Abrams helped to cover up the illegal transfer of arms to the Contras, was convicted for it, and later pardoned.  To a shockingly small amount of consternation, Abrams is now the ambassador to another South American country on the brink of a civil war with US-backed right-wing rebels looking to topple a ""socialist"" regime. Since I didn't get to it here, you'll have to check out Abrams' [Contras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras) for yourself.

Looking for liberal opinion on justification for higher taxes-,"‚ÄîTLDR at bottom‚Äî

To start off, our country (US) needs to see some tax reform. We need a lot more tax brackets, as a single person making $200 million a year is being taxed the same as a single person making over $500,001 a year. 

However, I do have an issue with taxes past 50%. I am currently in college, and will be graduating with double STEM majors a semester early. I‚Äôm not trying to flex about how smart I am, because it hasn‚Äôt been easy. I bust my ass every week to get good grades. My upcoming summer will consist of working and studying for my CFA in the winter (basically a finance CPA). Meanwhile, the vast majority of my peers are doing majors that are far easier and committing much less time to them. The people I went to high school with that didn‚Äôt go to college are not hard workers. 

I‚Äôm just curious how people justify high taxes (50%+) for people that have worked very hard to get to where they are. I‚Äôd like to understand the other side on this, and I think it‚Äôs important we have these conversations. 

Little bit of stats I‚Äôm going to provide; 

https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat36.pdf
A very small % of the workforce works 2 jobs. A tiny fraction is working 2 full time jobs. 

https://www.nber.org/digest/jul06/w11895.html
""Between 1979 and 2002, the frequency of long work hours increased by 14.4 percentage points among the top quintile of wage earners, but fell by 6.7 percentage points in the lowest quintile.""

TLDR: How do you reconcile taxing people that work hard to make more money at a much higher rate than most of the US populace? 

Also, I want to throw out there that I would not have a problem with up to 65/70% rate on income over ~$15 million. ",Liberal,1553032269,throwaway1947262,0,1,True,2019-03-19

It's clear that parties switched ideologies, because now, it is Republicans who attract more racists, including KKK for whose founding they blame Democrats.

This fact alone proves that the parties are not the same. But since Reps still point out to the fact that after so many years of blacks voting Dems, they still face racism and poverty, as if they wanted to keep them dependent.

The Case for Deplatforming,"  

Oftentimes the topic of free speech is spoken of in binary terms. Either you‚Äôre for it or against it. But is that really the nature of this debate or are we actually talking about several rights and moral principles that oftentimes find themselves in conflict with one another. I think a certain segment of so-called free speech advocates need to be brought to task about the hidden assumptions of their argument. Namely that free speech is the highest moral principle and that all others are secondary to it.

In July of 2016 former Breitbart tech Editor and internet troll Milo Yiannopolis was banned from Twitter for the third and final time as a consequence to his tweets about comedian and SNL actress Leslie Jones in regards to her role in the 2016 reimagining of Ghostbusters. 

The Ghostbusters film became the latest victim of the modern culture war due to its largely female cast as opposed to the original Ghostbusters movie which exclusively featured all-male leads. Milo was just one of several individuals involved in the harassment campaign against the actresses in the movie with Leslie Jones being especially singled out for ridicule due to the fact that she was not only female but also black. 

Several jokes posted by Milo referenced Leslie Jones race and included insinuations that she was or looked like a man. Furthermore, many of Milo‚Äôs followers made fake tweets that implied that Leslie Jones was anti-Semitic, homophobic and racist towards whites. Twits that Milo, whom I should point out is the editor of the technology section of a conservative online news organization, screen capped and shared with the rest of his 300,000+ followers without confirming or perhaps caring whether the twits were real.  

While expressing criticism of Milo as an insincere troll who approaches everything as a performance free speech advocate and fellow provocateur Sam Harris complained that twitter and the biased liberal media had been unfair to Milo given that twitter apparently doesn‚Äôt ban jihadists reliably enough for his taste.  Now one has to admire Harris‚Äô ability to relate everything to Islamic extremism but one would think that if he had time to compare the matter to the completely unrelated topic of terrorism he would have at least found the time to mention the specifics surrounding Milo Yiannopolis‚Äô banning rather than casually throwing around accusations of a conspiracy of liberal media bias based on flimsy evidence.

As self-serving as the narrative of liberal bias is to Sam Harris‚Äô own career as an internet provocateur there‚Äôs another more plausible explanation for twitter‚Äôs actions. Profit motive. One of Leslie Jones own twits related to the incident with Milo demonstrates this quite well. ‚ÄúI use to wonder why some celebs don‚Äôt have Twitter accts. Now I know. You can‚Äôt be nice and communicate with fans cause people are crazy.‚Äù She went on to say in another tweet. ‚ÄúI leave Twitter tonight with tears and a very sad heart. All this cause I did a movie. You can the movie but the shit I got today‚Ä¶wrong.‚Äù 

[https://www.vox.com/2016/7/20/12226070/milo-yiannopoulus-twitter-ban-explained](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/20/12226070/milo-yiannopoulus-twitter-ban-explained)

Contrary to Harris‚Äô claim twitter is not driven by progressive politics. If anything Twitter and other social media sites are generally loathe to regulate content on their sites due in no small part to the costs it would incur. The harassment that Leslie Jones suffered however was a hit to their reputation. Celebrities drive millions of viewers to their site and as big of a following a few dozen internet trolls may have celebrities will undoubtedly drive more traffic. Simply put it‚Äôs not in Twitter‚Äôs financial interest to allow rampant harassment on their site. If they did such harassment would drive everyone but the trolls themselves off of it and Twitter would make far less money. Then a competitor with higher standards would come around and take the lead in their corner of the social media market. 

So the situation is not as black and white as some would have others believe. There are several moral principles at play here. There‚Äôs Milo‚Äôs right to free speech. There‚Äôs Leslie Jones right to be free of harassment and not be slandered. And there‚Äôs Twitters right to free association, regulate the use of their property and protect their reputation. In this particular case Twitter choose to protect its rights and perhaps incidentally Leslie Jones at Milo‚Äôs expense. It‚Äôs not a given that the principle of free speech should take precedent over all other concerns and given the fate of Milo‚Äôs career Twitters decision indisputably worked out for the best.

In 2018 Milo Yiannapolis would be invited to the Conservative Political Action Committee or CPAC. CPAC is an annual conservative conference notorious for its controversial speakers. One frequent speaker Ann Coulter suggested once that women be deprived of the right to vote because they vote Democrat too often. Other speakers have included Michelle Malkin who wrote a book defending the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII and former Republican Senator Rick Santorum who criticized the Lawrence v Texas decision of the Supreme Court. You know the decision that made it illegal to literally incarcerate people for having gay sex.

But apparently Milo was too controversial for even CPAC because many of its sponsors expressed dissatisfaction with CPAC Organizer Matt Schlapp‚Äôs decision to invite Milo to CPAC 2017 without consulting them. Or perhaps the real problem was the fact that Milo is gay. In any case nothing could be done about it now. If CPAC banned Milo they‚Äôd have to contend with his thousands of loyal fans who were more than willing to start a harassment campaign of spreading lies and spouting racially charged obscenities at CPAC affiliated institutions if they dared revoke the invitation. You know because free speech. Highest moral priority and all. 

But leading up to the event videos resurfaced of Milo defending sexual relationships between adult men and teenage boys. Finally, CPAC sponsors got the excuse they needed and Matt Schlapp was given no choice but to rescind his invitation to let Milo speak at CPAC. These events were quickly followed by Milo being fired from Breitbart, losing his book deal and basically all other means of making easy money by being a troll. Finally, Milo said something irredeemably stupid, which was encourage the exploitation of minors for sexual gratification. But is that really how low the bar should be set to expunge someone from the public debate?  

I‚Äôve already articulated that free speech isn‚Äôt the only moral principle out there and how advocates of free speech tend to ignore them but that‚Äôs not the only problem here. I think the manner in which some free speech advocates talk about this issue actually works to undermine free speech as a moral principle. In the past five or so years the topic of free speech almost always comes up in the context of accusations of some form of expressed bigotry. Many of these accusations are illegitimate but let‚Äôs be honest, most of them are not. 

In December of 2018 Carl Benjamin, better known as Sargon of Akkad, a prominent youtuber known for his involvement in the Gamergate Scandal was banned from Patreon citing their hate speech guidelines. Patreon doesn‚Äôt produce content per say but instead functions as a means for content creators to receive money i.e. patronage from their supporters. In an interview on another creator‚Äôs youtube channel Sargon said the following:

*‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt be bothered with people who chose to treat me like this. It‚Äôs really annoying. Like, I* *‚Äî* *. You‚Äôre acting like a bunch of n\*\*\*\*\*s, just so you know. You act like white n\*\*\*\*\*s. Exactly how you describe black people acting is the impression I get dealing with the Alt Right. I‚Äôm really, I‚Äôm just not in the mood to deal with this kind of disrespect.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúLook, you carry on, but don‚Äôt expect me to then have a debate with one of your f\*\*gots.‚Ä¶Like why would I bother?‚Ä¶Maybe you‚Äôre just acting like a n\*\*\*\*r, mate? Have you considered that? Do you think white people act like this? White people are meant to be polite and respectful to one another, and you guys can‚Äôt even act like white people, it‚Äôs really amazing to me.*

[https://patreonhq.com/hate-speech-on-patreon-a9026e52c2cf](https://patreonhq.com/hate-speech-on-patreon-a9026e52c2cf)

Sargon‚Äôs fellow provocateurs including Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin took umbrage with Patreon‚Äôs clearly amoral decision to no longer facilitate financial support to someone who violated their guidelines and decided to call for a boycott of Patreon. But they‚Äôre not hurting Patreon who would only end up losing the very people they don‚Äôt want on their platform anyway. In fact, I would argue their hurting free speech.

There‚Äôs a political concept called framing that refers to the way ideas are conveyed such that they come across as appealing or unappealing as possible to further a particular narrative. Free speech advocates are very good at framing the free speech debate in binary terms. It‚Äôs easy to win the debate when framed as a battle between those who favor free speech and those who don‚Äôt but as I suggested at the beginning of this podcast that‚Äôs not the real discussion. In recent years free speech is almost always brought up within the context of hate speech and while a binary framing may help you win the battle the hate speech framing won‚Äôt help win the war.

Hate speech has victims like Leslie Jones and those victims along with their supporters are being presented with a choice by Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin. A false choice that you can only be for free speech if you tolerate the proliferation of hate speech. 

During the Civil Rights Era, Rosa Parks was selected to be the face of the Montgomery boycott. This wasn‚Äôt an arbitrary decision. She wasn‚Äôt the first person to refuse to give up her seat to a white man but she was the ideal representative for the cause. Rosa Parks allowed Civil Rights activists to control the debate and frame their cause as one where hardworking, honest African Americans were unjustly being subjected to discrimination by Montgomery‚Äôs public transportation system. The Rosa Parks of the Free Speech movement however are mostly unapologetic hatemongers like Milo Yianaopolis, Sargon of Akkad and Ann Coulter. Not exactly compelling mascots for a cause.

It‚Äôs important to understand that free speech, barring government intervention is simply a moral principle not a legal requirement. It‚Äôs enforcement hinges on the perceived mutual interest of everyone within society to uphold it. When free speech becomes so strongly associated as a rhetorical, partisan shorthand to protect bigots from the repercussions of what they say it becomes nothing more than a euphemism like state‚Äôs rights or religious freedom. It stops meaning what it is supposed to mean and just becomes an excuse to be an asshole. 

And what does anyone actually gain from this bargain? Does giving Milo getting another book deal in any meaningful way advance the discussion of‚Ä¶ well anything? Did his harassment campaigns against several women really contribute to the discussion of gender relations or minority representation in media? What exactly was Ann Coulter‚Äôs contribution to American society when her anti-immigrant ramblings pressured the President of the United States to go back on a deal and shutdown the government for the longest period in American history leaving thousands of Americans without a pay check. What is the actual material benefit of hate speech?

Now I would point out that there are legitimate concerns here. People are falsely accused of hate speech and de-platformed as a result. A robust attempt to weed out any provocative discussion by institutions and social media platforms can overreach. But criticizing every crackdown regardless of the reason doesn‚Äôt help. The ‚Äúmarketplace of ideas‚Äù if you want to generously call public discourse that like any market requires regulation to work effectively.  Not every participant in the market is selling a product worth selling and without oversight the rampant distribution of bad ideas can cause people to lose faith in the market. 

Furthermore, public discourse has limited bandwidth and if it‚Äôs crowded out by trolls and bigots then every discussion becomes about the very thing said trolls and bigots say they hate, identity politics. As long as we‚Äôre debating whether or not Mexicans are murderers and rapists we‚Äôre not debating the actual merits of immigration policy.

Rights are not absolute moral proclamations. Not unless you‚Äôre an anarchist or libertarian, two of the most simplistic and politically unsuccessful moral ideologies known to man. Rights are ideas that have to be carefully considered within the relevant context and more often than not work against one another. The answers as to how we weight and consider rights in relation to one another are not easy or obvious and sometimes certain rights will have to supersede others. All because someone doesn‚Äôt think a given right is the most important in one context doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll feel the same in other. And you‚Äôll be hard pressed to find someone who thinks a given right should supersede another in all contexts. Even if they claim they do for profit related motives.",Liberal,1553795150,rodog22,0,1,True,2019-03-28

In defense of open free conversation.,"In my youth I was a very different person. I was a devout Catholic and followed the dictates of the Church. This meant I was anti-abortion, I had a fairly archaic view of gender relationships and roles. Same sex marriage was definite NO. Marriage was between a man and woman, and you had to have children... the list goes on. At university in a feminist class I said something embarrassingly male, to the tune of, 'the only reason feminism exists is because men allow it.' 

Anyway today I hold none of these views, my entire perspective has shifted. But if I held these views as a young Catholic today, my mind would never have been changed. Why? I would not have been allowed to express my views in pro-liberal spaces... I would have been called a sexist and told to shut up, or get lost, or worse. And to be clear I was sexist, but I wasn't called sexist/homophobic, or hateful, or anything of that sort. Even though I absolutely was?

That pro-liberal space instead did something I found so interesting that I was hooked in hard. It asked me to defend my positions with argument and discussion. We then as a group, me a male sitting at a table with a bunch of women, went through those arguments. We deconstructed them, I was introduced to counter arguments (This was my feminist reading group at university), and my mind began to change.

On everything, now I am pro-choice, sort same sex marriage... the works.

But what I cannot support is this sub's refusal to allow a sexist viewpoint to be expressed. How does the sexist learn the error of their ways? Let me tell you I am a disagreeable person by nature... and if your approach to my Catholic views was hostile I would have gone to war with you. You would kick me off the sub, but you would fail. You would fail to convince me of your position, I would be politically against you an enemy. Whereas if you had, as the feminist reading group I was a part of at university a million years ago, had invited me to discuss and disagree then I would have converted to being a liberal.

Those women in that group put up with me, and my  mind was changed. Now you can legitimately say they should not have had to put up with my younger self. Yes I agree... the thing is in reality I existed as I did, the mindset I had (informed by dogmatic Catholicism) still exists. But it is one that can be changed. But only if you engage in the conversation and work past the sexism/homophobia to converse with the person.

Look perhaps this will get me kicked or down voted. But I find they only way too convince is to have the conversation you might not want to have. With the person you don't want to have it, where you're not going to be welcome. At the end of the say I am still up for debate, argument and a heated exchange I just do it on the side of pro-choice ect.

Shutting the discussion down will not end you in the place you want. I am already stuck in a situation wherein the only people willing to debate I don't consider myself aligned with at all. All you accomplish by rejecting the conversation is polarization and enemies. What happens if the votes (or worse) don't go your way?",Liberal,1555060039,mjhrobson,27,1,True,2019-04-12

What is Progress to the Victim?,"Many pundits and politicians argue that anti-racism protestors fail to appreciate the racial progress we have made in America. There is no doubt that this country has made advancements to ameliorate some of its racial atrocities. Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B Du Bois, Dr. King, Ida B. Wells, Malcolm X, Thurgood Marshall, and infinitely more African-Americans ensured, through sacrifice, that life for the next generation would be better than their own. And while I am eternally grateful for the efforts of these selfless heroes, I do not rejoice in the crumbs of progress that a hostile government begrudgingly ceded. In fact, I do not put much value into the idea of racial ‚Äòprogress‚Äô to begin with. I am tired of hearing about progress. Too often, the myth of progress tempts us into toxic complacency.

Maybe I am ‚Äòungrateful‚Äô. But if a man first shoots me and then later steals my wallet, I will not praise his progress. I do not see the progress that many speak of. The income gap between black and white households is roughly the same today as it was in 1970. Seemingly every month there is another video of an unarmed black man having his future stolen from him by state violence. Black schools are still underfunded and understaffed, while the government has poured money into a racially targeted drug war‚Ä¶ Admittedly, those inequities are not as insuperable as slavery or segregation. But what is progress to the victim? What did progress do for Tamir Rice? What did it do for Laquan MacDonald? Walter Scott? Freddie Gray? Trayvon Martin? Eric Garner? Alton Sterling? Philando Castille? Michael Brown? Sandra Bland? Keith Lamont? Or Kalief Browder? My guess is that the grieving families of these murdered humans care very little to praise this government‚Äôs ‚Äúprogress‚Äù. Their loved ones were slain by the same disease that enchained their ancestors - racism. The only thing that ‚Äòprogressed‚Äô was the method of destroying their black bodies - not the result. How can I call that progress? I do not see the progress in fighting to keep the Confederate flag over a monument instead of a battlefield. I do not see the progress in being enchained by a warden rather than a plantation owner. I do not see the progress in trading in those white hoods for red MAGA hats. We are either equal, or we are not. We are either free, or we are not. Anything in between is not ‚Äòprogress‚Äô; it is injustice.",Liberal,1555366079,celebratedmagician,0,1,True,2019-04-15

Why not have a citizenshiop question on the census?,"hey.  I'm what the altright would call a ""cuckservative"".  I'm right of center, lean libertarian, but am convincable.

IDK the current status of it, but for a while there was a debate about putting a citizenship question the census.  To my understanding, the liberal rationale against it is that a citizenship question would scare people away from answering.

but I recently had a moral thought.  Back in the era of the founding, the framers enshrined slavery in our constitution with the ""3/5 compromise"".  Slaves could not vote, but slave owners wanted to inflate the population of their states so they used the non-voting subjugated class as fodder to increase their voting power.

How is counting non-citizens different from that?  You are counting an at risk group of people in order to boost the voting power of the dominant class.  Does that not inherantly go against the idea of ""one man; one vote"" when you count the non-voters for the sake of congressional representation?  Is that not inherantly anti-liberal?  furthermore, this ""overcounting"" would primarily help ""blue"" states, (CA, NY, NJ have over 20% of their population foreign born"", and liberals complain about how red states overrepresent themselves.

1. no dd-214 says ""honorably discharged""
2. you cannot be dishonorably discharged for being AWOL except in cases of:
 - deployment AWOL (not the case as the Native vet was not deployed, but worked on base)
 - being AWOL for 30 days plus (also not the case. His infractions were three individual, non-consecutive shifts)

The fact that it is worded in the article as a question, ""I wonder why it doesn't say honorably discharged"" is a clever tactic being used because they *know* it isn't evidence of a dishonorable discharge, and by asking a question they avoid libel/slander.

Conservative here. Would like to discuss the recently proposed (by VA Dems) Repeal Act (HB2491),"Hi. Just wanna start off by saying I don't want to argue pro-life vs pro-choice or anything like that. Only reason I came here is because I felt this would be the best place to hear from some pro-choice people on this bill. 

Here's the text from a conversation between Todd Gilbert (R) and Kathy Tran (D) about the details of this bill (video link will be put in comment since my original post was removed for having a Twitter link in it)

&gt;Gilbert: So how late in the third trimester would you be able to do that?

&gt;Tran: It‚Äôs very unfortunate that our physician witnesses were not able to attend today.

&gt;Gilbert: No, I‚Äôm talking about your bill. How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?

&gt;Tran: Or physical health.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. I‚Äôm talking about the mental health.
Tran: Through the third trimester. The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. But to the end of the third trimester?

&gt;Tran: Yep. I don‚Äôt think we have a limit in the bill.

&gt;Gilbert: Where it‚Äôs obvious a woman is about to give birth, that she has physical signs that she is about to give birth. Would that be a point at which she could still request an abortion if she was so certified? She‚Äôs dilating.

&gt;Tran: Mr. Chairman, that would be a decision that the doctor, the physician, and the woman would make at that point.

&gt;Gilbert: I understand that. I‚Äôm asking if your bill allows that.

&gt;Tran: My bill would allow that, yes.

Friendly conservative here with a question for you on abortion...,"Please keep it respectful -

I know that not all liberals believe the same things as other liberals and that not all conservatives believe the same things as other conservatives, so I‚Äôm not trying to categorize anyone by way of their political beliefs or otherwise when I ask this.

In regards to this abortion hype with the extended abortion term period... I can objectively see why this law is in place. I may not agree with it, but I can see how the law would help someone that wants to get an abortion and not have to jump through as many hoops as there are currently. Fair.

This may be a dumb question, but would any of you actually abort a baby super late into the pregnancy term when it‚Äôs CLEARLY a formed being with a beating heart etc.. like.. 15 days to a month before the due date? What about a few seconds before?

This is not meant to offend anyone; I know you‚Äôre not a bunch of savages. I‚Äôm just trying to understand the minds of those I have disagreements with.

help me disprove the statements of my old white dad,"Though my dad claims he believes in ""live and let live,"" he voted for Trump and seems to have a distorted view on America and its people. I am only 23 years old so anytime I try to argue with him about human rights issues he says I am too young to know how the world works. 

Recently these discussions have revolved around race, particularly black people in America.

Here are some of the statements he made:

""When I was growing up in Illinois (in the 1950/60's) black people were a strong people... they did not feel oppressed. They worked hard. Now, black men abandon their families and leave black women with six children to care for on their own. 

""Many black people do not want to receive reparations because it makes them feel less than.""

He basically thinks that many black people choose to be unemployed in order to get money from the government and that black familial structures used to be stronger. He listed statistics of single black mothers and high unemployment rates of black men. He even brought up Asian immigrants to argue that they come to America and work hard, so why can't black people do the same thing?

NEWSFLASH DAD: BLACK PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OPPRESSED. TO SUGGEST THEY DO NOT CURRENTLY WORK HARD IS INSULTING AND PROBLEMATIC ON SO MANY LEVELS. 

It is super frustrating because I know he is so so so so wrong but I don't have any solid evidence/arguments other than that any negative statistic he reads about black communities is a consequence of the racist society they were forced into. All I manage to do is yell and my opinions/attempts to prove him wrong are further discredited.

I would appreciate any arguments (I will literally read them to him word for word), or articles with supporting evidence that will show him he is making extreme generalizations about black people.

"Counter points about hating ""Government""","A government is  the governing body of a nation, state, or community. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's that simple. It doesn't matter where you go, the moment more than one person is working together there is some kind of government at play.   


Today on Ask Trump Supporters, a question was posed asking when does the government best the private sector. Incredibly, the most common response is the Military. That command economy merit based society with high training, welfare, hands on management, held accountable, regulated faction of the United States that commands floating cities with more airpower than most nations in the world, and global reach.    


Ask for examples.  
When talking to anyone trying to sell you that the private, plutocratic, invisible hand mentality is the best way to go, ask for examples in real life and history. Because at no time in history did a plutocratic/ corporate society held out for long before the economy stagnated and corruption rotted that system of government to the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best reasons to have an organized governing structure is accountability, anti-corruption, data tiered data analysis of the people and resources, and bulk purchases of goods and services to supply to the public and prepare for disasters and issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Explain basic civics.**   
There are generally two axis to most government types. Power and authority on one, wealth and economy on the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

With power and authority, three of the most basic examples are easily explained as starting points. A single ruler (Monarch, Dictator), a layered rule (Republic, leader based), and a rule by the people (Democracy). Each with advantages and disadvantages.  


[https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher\_lessons/3branches/1.htm](https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

**A King.**

A single ruler is quick and easy. Fast and effective. However is quicker to corrupt and pursuaid into making bad decisions, especially when they believe they are the best of the best because of the seat of power they hold. In the States, we have the president who is elected mostly by the general population to fill this role, and can act as a dictator in times of emergencies and crisis. Because an imperfect action is often better than no action at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Representatives**

A layered rule such as a Republic or some kind of body of leaders offers better information and management of specialized tasks and responsibilities. It requires more effort to corrupt and distort as hopefully merit based and elected officials will have a shared say, and have to discuss with peers for actions. It also means they are held accountable by their peers if embezzlement or criminal activity is pursued or carried out. In the states we have Congress and the Senet. Elected into office by groups of people to represent them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule by all**

A total democracy is a full rule by the people, it's slow and a fools vote is equal to a scholar. Democracy is determined by how accountable the government is to the people, and whether or not the government reflect the populations best interest, or is corrupt and serving other powers such as a foreign body or corruption. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Wealth &amp; Economy**  
This is where Conservatives will tell you the government fails at most. Spending other people's money is the worst way to go about things and should be avoided at all cost and try to sell you that private business is the best way to go. I have no examples of when privatization was better than an uncorrupted government once funding was factored in. Every project in history performed best when it was given resources, proper management, and was held accountable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Economic Anarchy**  
Free Market and the invisible hand. Where the wealth is, incentives follow. No regulations or management is taken into account and theft against the poor and powerless via slavery is quick to take effect. Workers can't defend themselves against an organized power with money and marshal forces so they are limited to basic work. Micro empires rise as corporations, but in every instance, the most organized, regulated groups of people take over and the Freemarket disappears. It is the line when the greed get too greedy, paranoid, and are overthrown. The fall of Capitalism is when consumers are bankrupt and the wealthy blame them for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Command Economies, Socialism &amp; Communism.**

The very moment control is taken to manage resources is when a command economy takes shape. Socialism is where the governing body takes control of some or all services to enable the public to perform well, by mass managing, bulk buying and problem prevention through trends and analysis goods and services such as roads, military, disaster response, emergency response, medical, financial safety nets, disability management, and so on. The last elements to be taken over and the push into Communism occurs when luxury services and economic caps are put in place to regulate the wealthy and prevent them from becoming too powerful to manage, and leave ruin the state. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples**

We have many examples in history regarding the private sector taking over, and the moment a business opens shares to the public, workers comp and investments drop. The moment pro-profit healthcare was allowed under Reagan, we saw healthcare costs increase. When we look at public and private schools, the biggest factor is money. Public schools that are well funded and regulated perform just as well as private schools.   


In the United States, we have cities that specialize and perform better due to the focused mindset than if they were attempting to be jack of all trades social centers. Unless you seriously think everyone should design and build their own car from scratch, it's a very good idea that we have predictable settings such as roads that are maintained for specialized vehicles to operate on, designed by people who specialize in vehicular design. They couldn't design those cars if they were too busy farming and training in a militia. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My final thoughts ranting about this**

The only people who are trying to tell us the government is bad are people who are either ignorant of basic civics, economics, and history to know better, or are lying and trying to sell mass privatization to fleece the population of power and wealth.   


This has been a rant that is my observation and understanding to explain what the fuck a government is, because this argument is beyond stupid by now. I hope better people chime in here to correct and refine my attempt here. To create a post that can be easily linked to for educational purposes as to what the hell government is and why its used. Accountability and management.   


If you read this and hate the government, I honestly hope you chime in with outstanding examples of how the private sector, with the same economic resources, outperformed a managed government organization. Because as we have so far, Governments landed on the moon,[invented the computer](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000984.htm), built roads in Roman times, and as we see in the Military, are capable of identifying and applying organizational practices that give us the most bang for the buck. The only modern examples I can think of would be the fact that [NASA needs more funding.](https://www.21stcentech.com/money-spent-nasa-not-waste/)

&amp;#x200B;

So when you try to tell me that Government is stupid, or some other nonsense, I'm going to need you to clarify. Because as far as I'm concerned, corruption is the problem, and Conservatives don't hate organizations, they hate being held accountable and having regulations keep them in check from making money off the suffering of others.  


As usual, I'm going to post something I picked up somewhere. Two links that show how Conservatives are the problem in America, and I have yet to see anything that counter discusses this.

My frustrated email to the Department of Revenue,"""Hello,

I   am submitting documents to help prove that the levy placed onto my   account is my income and separate from any income of my mothers, \*\*\*\*\*\*  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Other than signing a piece of paper allowing me to open these   accounts as a minor in 2009 my mother is not linked to my checking and   savings account.

Currently, I am  attending graduate school at University of Wisconsin- Madison. My  only  source of income is from an Advance Opportunity Fellow for first   generation college students of underrepresented minorities and  non-minority disadvantaged graduate students beginning October 1st.   Direct deposits from the University occurs on the 1st of each month. I  have the stubs from the last 4 months attached.

I   hope this can be resolved quickly. I have no other sources of income   and have no other money to pay for food, gas, or bills than what is  being levied from my accounts.

In   addition to myself, I hope the Department of Revenue would consider   flexibility with my mother until she sells her restaurant and can pay   her back-taxes. We are a low income, minority, single parent family that   has struggled to survive, not the top 1%. A levy placed on money that   can be used to pay for food or make a house payment is a direct route  to  homelessness. Homelessness of one person costs the state and  taxpayers  substantially more money (approximately $35,000 per year)  than someone  who is behind on house taxes of a home valued at less than  $135,000. The  snowball effect of late fees and interest in one year  has turned $3,000 into $9,000 owed and is an exploitation of someone who  is trying to do what she can to  keep her small business open for the  time being and a roof over our  heads. She is not hiding money, she has  no money. Patience is all we can ask for.

Thank you for your understanding.

Kindly,

Media Dilemma?,"My political identity has changed a lot in the last few years. I used to be strictly conservative (I grew up in evangelical Christianity), but once I left my religion, I also started becoming more liberal.

Now, one thing I have a hard time thinking through is media bias. I watch CNN, NPR, and BBC news as well as read some things through PolitiFact. However, some of these are considered left-of-center, but they touch on issues that I believe are important, but have little nagging doubts from my conservative past about.

I also overhear stuff from peers from Fox News and singular conservative talk shows. It's all about the left lying and why Trump is trying his best and a very Christian bias, as well.

I just have a hard time wrapping my head around this pretty far-fetched concept of propaganda. Are the left wing sources propaganda that is indoctrination, or is it the right wing sources? If they both show different sides (albeit one being less alluring to me), aren't they both indoctrination in different ways?

Excuse me if I present any ignorance on this. ",Liberal,1549969546,Nastman1984,2,1,True,2019-02-12

Concentration Camps in the US?,"So, someone claimed the US was running concentration camps.

Someone else responded that that was bullshit, and honestly, that seemed the more reasonable side.

So I went digging for an hour, and here goes.

TLDR: oh my.  


\--------  
The camps at the border where we're putting people seeking asylum aren't even up to the standards of prisons, and many of the people in those camps have committed no crimes; they literally walked up to the wall, and said to the border patrol that they'd like to request asylum, as if they go back home, they're gonna die.

That bit is really really important; many of these people have broken no laws, and are following the exact procedure our government required of them. With the context of ""a good number of these people have done nothing wrong ""...  
\--------

The organization running the camps has said it holds no responsibility for their staff literally raping children:[https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/immigrants-rights-and-detention/ice-detention-center-says-its-not-responsible](https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/immigrants-rights-and-detention/ice-detention-center-says-its-not-responsible)

People also, you know, die in those camps, and it's more lately:[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/22-immigrants-died-ice-detention-centers-during-past-2-years-n954781](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/22-immigrants-died-ice-detention-centers-during-past-2-years-n954781)

They didn't \*used\* to die in those camps at the same rates; the current medical care may be part of the problem, as the medical care isn't good:

[https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/20/us-poor-medical-care-deaths-immigrant-detention](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/20/us-poor-medical-care-deaths-immigrant-detention)

Even for the asylum seekers - the people doing exactly what the law requires them to do! - we often strip their kids from them:[https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-asylum-seekers-prepare-to-cross-20180625-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-asylum-seekers-prepare-to-cross-20180625-story.html)

\--------  
Pausing: the asylum seekers know this might happen, and it's \*still\* better than turning back around and going home, which gives them some credibility when they say they're fleeing death. Which raises the question of what the hell they're running from.

In more than one of the cases, Central American countries had civil wars, a lot of the civil society got stomped on, and gangs are now rampant. The United States, through the CIA, was involved in those civil wars. The idea was usually ""stop communism"", and when the other option was ""authoritarian regime"", we armed the regime.

Guatamala: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/march99/guatemala11.htm](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/march99/guatemala11.htm)

\--------

Back to it, the US Government has no plans to allow asylum seekers to reunite with their kids:[https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-government-has-no-plan-for-reuniting-the-immigrant-families-it-is-tearing-apart](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-government-has-no-plan-for-reuniting-the-immigrant-families-it-is-tearing-apart)

And for some of those kids, the US Government... placed them with human traffickers.[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/politics/us-placed-immigrant-children-with-traffickers-report-says.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/politics/us-placed-immigrant-children-with-traffickers-report-says.html)

And we often keep them in cages. Not kennels, but still cages.[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/17/separation-border-children-cages-south-texas-warehouse-holding-facility](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/17/separation-border-children-cages-south-texas-warehouse-holding-facility)

Rounding it out, this one's easy. Let's look up the definition of ""concentration camp"".[https://www.google.com/search?q=concentration+camp](https://www.google.com/search?q=concentration+camp)*a place where large numbers of people, especially political prisoners or members of persecuted minorities, are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities, sometimes to provide forced labor or to await mass execution.*

So, the asylum seekers are making the claim that they're fleeing death, and we have good reason to believe that's true in some cases. They're seeking asylum because of persecution. We have them in cages, and the medical care we do provide winds up with a lotta people dead. We've accidentally sold kids into slavery, split kids from their parents, taken no responsibility when our contracting staff rapes the kids, and have no way of getting many of those children back to their parents... which is \*also\* technically human trafficking if we look at international law.

They're not doing labor \*or\* awaiting execution, but those are actually optional in the definition of a concentration camp. **I wish it wasn't the case, but yeah, by the quick definition, the US seems to be running concentration camps on the southern border.**

This may sound kinda intellectually dishonest and lazy but I haven't seen much of his videos, because I don't want to bother to come up with arguments against him, partly because I don't want to be ideologically challenged.
However I've read some stuff other liberals say about him. Like that he actually destroys everyone by ""gish galloping"", which evidently works. It's a method of debating by overwhelming opponent by lot of points, spoken very fast, sometimes even barely related to the original point. Then the opponent is challenged with big quantity of arguments regardless of how strong or weak, that cannot possibly be answered at once. Then I've read about some instances of his fallacies such as telling that fascism isn't everything a liberal disagrees with, yet tweeted a lot of political (or politically motivated) moves he disagreed with and called them fascist, his tweet which suggested that he is unfamiliar with concept of renewable energy, his obvious climate change denial of that he once compared Healthcare to expensive furniture.
I saw some videos debunking him such as by polidice, which are interesting.
There are other issues I don't know he's correct about and should be taken seriously, but I hadn't look them up yet. Anyway, what is your take on his positions and how credible is he?
Speaking of credibility, he clearly loses most of it simply by working at FOX News, Daily Wire and Breitbart. According MediaBiasFactCheck, the latter to are far right biased and have low informative value.
And most importantly, how come apparently nobody on the left can beat him with rational arguments? Who could? ",Liberal,1551314469,Proud3GnAthst,0,1,True,2019-02-27

Immigrants can be racist too,"Hey guys. I had a complaint about liberal philosophy. I am specifically speaking to the those people who are Democrats or Liberals, support candidates like Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Barrack Obama, Justin Trudeau. 

In liberal philosophy, there is a huge outrage against white supremacists, white racists, conservative racists. However, I never hear you guys, or any news station, speaking about racist immigrants.

I believe that immigrants can be racist too, and some are. Of course not all of them, but some of them. When they come to America, they come thinking ‚ÄúI love my race, and I hate middle eastern‚Äù  or they dislike Black people, or they dislike white people, etc etc.

What does it take to get through to Trump supporters?,"I genuinely don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre too dumb to realize he‚Äôs a complete dumpster fire of a president or they‚Äôre too prideful to admit it. And this isn‚Äôt about his (idiotic) policies, this is about him being so blatantly unfit for the position with absolutely no capacity or willingness to learn the job.

I can‚Äôt believe these people are okay with having an unhinged middle school bully running the country, let alone *worshiping* one like they do. 

Honestly, what do you think it would take for them to at least step back for a second and say, ‚ÄúHmm, maybe this orange buffoon isn‚Äôt the God-send we thought he was‚Äù? 

It‚Äôs clear that you can‚Äôt reason with these people. They just go with whatever their gut tells them and won‚Äôt back down no matter how much evidence to the contrary. Just like their dear leader. So things like reports of corruption in the administration don‚Äôt seem to be a promising route to any intellectual paradigm shifts. Trump could be put behind bars and they‚Äôll still claim it‚Äôs all a deep state conspiracy run by Obama and Hillary.




But there has to be a breaking point. 

He‚Äôs mocked veterans. He‚Äôs sided with violent foreign powers over his own country. He doesn‚Äôt have a consistent belief about anything. He‚Äôs bragged about committing sexual assault. He hasn‚Äôt spoken a coherent sentence in 17 years. Foreign leaders view him as a complete joke. He doesn‚Äôt lead our country with any shred of honesty or dignity. And he‚Äôs just so fucking stupid.


I seriously wonder how much support he would lose if he shot someone on fifth avenue. 




What news story could break tomorrow that you genuinely think would make a sizable dent in a his support?

Keep in mind, we‚Äôre talking about people who are denser than the earth‚Äôs core. I‚Äôve said ‚Äúthis *has* to be it‚Äù a hundred times, and I‚Äôve been wrong a hundred times. What‚Äôs something that wouldn‚Äôt just be tossed onto the pile and forgotten about by next week? And I don‚Äôt mean something like doing the truffle shuffle and castrating himself on the White House front lawn.  But seeing how far down the rabbit hole we already are, clearly it has to be something pretty outlandish. 

Think about every different shit show that‚Äôs happened on practically a weekly basis and think about how unwavering his voters have been in their support. How much worse could he act and still maintain his base‚Äôs devout loyalty? I know there‚Äôs a line out there that can be crossed, but I‚Äôm really struggling to see where it‚Äôs drawn.

(CONNECTICUT) CRIMINAL JUSTICE-PRISON-POLICE-SOCIAL-WELFARE-SCHOOL REFORM,"**It comes down to really 2 things:**

**(1)The environment in the home (kids need a stable and disciplined home)**

**(2)Lack of college education.**

&amp;#x200B;

**HAVE IN MIND:**

**The government does not own anyone** and we must remember the goal is to mainly reform and then use to contribute to the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

**GOALS:**

To reform and **give the tools to fully integrate** to contribute and prevent recidivism and broken homes.

**(1)Automatic erasure of all misdemeanors after 1 year** after offense and 2 years after offense for most felonies.

The longer you wait to pardon, the more recidivism and victims of crime you create.

**(2)Eliminate parole, probation, half-way houses**, ankle bracelets and others that contribute to recidivism and cost the state way too much. Once they‚Äôve paid their debt (prison), let them go.

**(3)Prison sentencing**:

* **No prison for all misdemeanors** (just an overnight jail stay). Instead, we use the same system that's used for child support to automatically **deduct a percentage from their work check for 2 years**.
* Felonies that require less than 5 years do that time but anything that requires 5-15 just do 5 years. 15 1/2 or more just do 15 years. **Sentences can not exceed 15 years**.
* The mission of **prison is to reform to then help integrate** to then have them contribute. It's an investment. The most serious offenders like serial killers, mass shooters, mass rapers, sex traffickers, etc, get life and there's no parole.
* Crimes of survival are given no more than 15 years.

**(4)Inside prison reform**:

* **If you're doing 5 years or more, you must get your GED (or easier CT version diploma that can be introduced) and a college or trade degree in order to be released**.
* Those who do not cooperate will simply be left in prison until they do.
* **One person per cell**. Never two.
* The whole prison system will revolve around rehabilitation for full integration and correction officer safety.

**(5)Police reform**:

* **Licenses for all police** that can have points taken off and can even be revoked which will not allow them to be hired by another town if fired by the first one. If you're not professional enough for one town, you're a hazard and a liability (lawsuit) for another.
* **Body cameras for all police officers**. Citizens can access bodycam footage pertaining to their case. This is already being done by NYPD.
* **Business cards for all police** to give to those they have cases with. This is already being done by NYPD.
* **End the 'blue line' of secrecy and lying for one another**. It does not work in the favor of the people who pay their salaries (citizens they swore to protect). It's criminal and promotes criminal behavior and mentalities inside police departments.
* **The top 2 killers of police are traffic stops and domestic cases**.
* **No police pullovers or looking up plates anymore** unless vehicle behavior or condition is a threat to public safety or there's an APB out for vehicle. Tickets can be sent to address if there's a small violation. No need to pull anyone over and risk your life.
* **In domestic cases, both (or all) parties should be arrested** if they insist on the other being arrested. Children will go with relatives. This will end the charades and notion that one can rebel against their partner, provoke a fight and violent response, and then one can call police as a weapon.
* **Police quotas in any form should result in license revocation**, fine, and prison time. Same goes for those officers who assault detained suspects.
* **Infiltrate every police department** and have multiple informants there to keep tabs on all of their activities. Compartmentalize by giving different paper lists to different people. Info can't be hacked since it's on paper and it would be impossible to expose the whole thing since no one has the whole list.
* **Eliminate police raids and only go for the big fish** or terror-related threats. Go after the leaks instead of attacking the water. Have feds dirty their hands and use up their funds.
* **Eliminate Trump administration laws that oppress minorities and that give police more leeway to shoot**. We can't turn neighborhoods into shooting ranges.
* **De-militarize and de-gang police** and keep tabs on the federal training they receive.
* **Eliminate civil forfeiture** completely. It promotes corruption.
* **Eliminate polygraph tests for police job entrance** which have proven to be unreliable (NYPD, the biggest police force in the US, doesn't use them). Background check, testimonies of character, psychological exam as well as mental health history check shall do. If polygraph tests really worked, we would have perfect police with perfect police conduct.
* **End racial discrimination of gun permits**. They're based on the Constitution, not by the decision of a police chief who bases it off race many times from what I'm told. Going to state police who run a criminal and mental health background check should be enough.
* Killing the black market should be on the agenda and **legalizing firearm ownership more (like we're doing for marijuana) will reduce the black market for firearms which are responsible for the majority of gun-related street homicides**. Preservation of one‚Äôs own life or life of a loved one transcends laws of men.

**(6)Home reform**:

* **Eliminate child support and alimony** which promote financial rewards for breaking up families and encourage single-parent homes who do not and cannot contribute to the economy like two-parent homes can. The damage it does to children is life-long.
* **Marriage licenses should be required in order to receive temporary public assistance**. It will discourage and limit welfare fraud and will encourage two-parent homes who normally don‚Äôt need public assistance as much as single-parent homes.
* **Prenups should be automatic by law**. This will encourage two-parent homes.
* **By law, every job available in CT should be on**[ **Indeed.com**](https://indeed.com/) **and all employers in CT must hire from there**. **$15-16 an hour minimum wage**. **Every employment agency works for the state to end unemployment quickly**. **State union for all who work to make it harder to get fired**. **Employers encouraged and rewarded for making mostly full-time positions**. **You‚Äôre paid for 40 hours even if you just do 32**. Annuities from NY Life promoted.
* **Eliminate all CT Works centers**. Public assistance is temporary anyways.
* **Respect religious exemptions** and just plain ole ""no"" from parents who do not want to vaccinate their children.
* **Flu shot can not be required for any job**. No one can force something inside your body.
* **Protect families from DCF quotas and legal power to separate them**. De-fund them. If CT is against the inhumanity of Trump separating families at the border, then we should be fired up even more about American families being separated by strangers who just want more funding and just put children in worse homes where they'll more than likely be molested or sold in sex trafficking. Citizens aren't property for the government to threaten you out of your children. All I see DCF doing is taking advantage of minorities inability to afford legal help and taking their children in order to get funding.

**(7)School reform**:

* Condense high school curriculum.
* **Have students start college or trade degrees in high school**.
* **Job placement before graduation**.
* Driving schools are part of all high schools (start in major cities).
* **Body sculpting/building training should be done 4 days a week** and mandatory in order to graduate.
* **Make it illegal to drop-out of school and not have a high school diploma and college** or trade degree. **Those without either normally turn to crime and welfare**.
* Since high schools are the biggest target for mass shooters and bomb plotters, **metal detectors and bag checks should be at every high school entrance** like they did for Danbury high school which eliminated weapon-related threats and violence.
* **Station 3-4 police officers in every school**. From Elementary to High school.
* **Vaccines are never required** since the other students are vaccinated.
* **Home schooling options are made simpler for parents** through online schooling which **save the state money** by having less students at school.",Liberal,1545586016,Americanglock,0,1,True,2018-12-23

"Maybe ""Institutional racism"" is the wrong word for the right concept","I feel as if a lot of people, including myself, have been confused by the term ""institutional racism"" for a long time. I'm not black, but I'm not white. I'm Pakistani, for clarification. The term implies that racism is written into laws, among all else; at least I thought so. In reality, an example of institutional racism would be a proposition to build a factory being lobbied by rich white men in the city to be placed near a black community rather than a white community since there are already things like a jail next to that neighborhood, therefor causing the people in that community, primarily black, to have a higher risk of lung problems due to immediate pollution. None of that had to do with law directly, and more had to do with the actions of selfish individuals. (Also, I should add that I got this analogy directly from a top comment on another reddit thread regarding racism that I can't find necessarily) I truly believe that a lot of what holds back the idea of institutional racism is the name of the term itself. America is a HIGHLY individualistic society, so if racism isn't being written into the laws I get the feeling that ""Institutional racism"" doesn't really make sense around here.

&amp;#x200B;

At the core, you have to have people understand that affirmative action is not founded in injustice, but actually serves a greater role. If the median+average black income is lower than the median+average white income, then affirmative action is a long-term solution with short-term frictions. If black people are 13% of the population in a city, they should hopefully be 13% of businesses in that city as well. This applies for all forms of AA. Of course, if AA is implemented BADLY, like a poor Asian kid not getting into college while a suburban black kid does, then of course it deserves to get called out. But of course there should always be a re-iteration of its purpose whenever things like this happens, or conservatives will eat up progress by taking those on the fence regarding these issues. Liberals have to be just in order to keep their ideals strong and favorable in front of moderates. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what's this rank all amounting to? Basically, if some old lady judge who works at your local court and determines a black man needs to wait until a court date for a 25 over speeding ticket but a white man can pay and plead guilty beforehand, that's ""institutional racism"" but it's not institutional racism. That old lady judge could be replaced with a young, modern man with very minimalist profiling tendencies. The institution didn't change, but the individual did. This is the sort of thing conservatives use to de-legitimize the actual meaning of ""institutional racism"" and play enough semantics that moderates feel afraid to use the term. This snowballs into an argument against AA, which is already misunderstood because the big picture starts to matter less than individual stories.

  
A better term might be ""incomplete egalitarianism"" to describe the system as it is. If everyone had true equal opportunity, but a demographic had a lower average income than another, than even 100 generations from now that demographic would still have a lower average income. Incomplete egalitarianism acknowledges that the goal we're looking for is egalitarianism, but the road to it has to involve more opportunity given to those with inherently less opportunity (on average). Though please, I'm not that smart and I know that sounds dumb, so anyone with a better alternative is welcome. ",Liberal,1545926180,Marisa_Nya,0,1,True,2018-12-27

A theory on Trump &amp; the shut down,"Ok, this is all guess work, I'm hoping some fellow liberals can help me flesh out this possible conspiracy theory.  

If we assume that Trump is working for Putin, which seems obvious to me after he announced removing US troops from Syria.

Add the fact that Trump said he'd let the Shutdown go for a year plus.

I think Putin ordered Trump to shut down the government, and leave it shut down until all the federal workers quit since they need money to live.  He even announced after the shutdown begin that he was cancelling all federal pay raises.  

Imagine the chaos that would proceed if there was NO USA government.  It could even be a prelude to an actual Russian attack.

A win win scenario,"Have we considered that perhaps the best result for the majority of the United States, might be in the secession of the Bible Belt which is really the only thing truly allowing the continued existence of the Republican Party as a legitimate power in politics. And frankly a lot of those states seem quite discontent being here, so why not grant them that wish.",Liberal,1546841333,AegonIConqueror,1,1,True,2019-01-07

Being accused of having TDS,"Anyone have any suggestions for arguing with people that accuse you of being a ""hater"" or having TDS, or ""just trying to divide with no interest in facts""?

Conservative libertarian here...,"To preface, I am not a big fan of Trump or his conduct, personality, etc. But I do support the majority of his conservative policies. I have a few questions to ask purely out of curiosity and to produce constructive debate (hopefully this skill work)

The left wing media seems to praise the New Democrat House with Nancy Pelosi as speaker. AOC also proves to be unexpectedly popular. Do all Democrats support these two, or is there a substantial amount of democrats who do not support them?

My second question is about trumps ‚Äúwall‚Äù. Which admittedly he poorly advertised. Think of the wall as a renovation of border infrastructure, which many border patrol have asked for and demonstrated a need. For most of our history, border security was a no brained and both GOP and Democrats alike agreed on a stringent border policy. Now that focus seems to change. What are the reasons for this belief that border policy can be ‚Äúad lib-ed‚Äù. In your opinion what about renovating the border to a secure wall is evil. Pretend that tump wasn‚Äôt president and some other republican proposed it, why is a wall such an evil, in compassionate thing?

Thanks for your responses",Liberal,1546913150,jbengle,0,1,True,2019-01-07
Why no border?,What is so terrible about having a border wall between Mexico and the US? Genuine question as in I am trying to learn. I‚Äôm not trying to start a debate with anybody.

Add furries to sex education.,"This is an important part of what people identify as. By adding people who identify as furry to sex education in school, this will raise much more awareness and acceptance to furry culture.
