Global warming hypocrite and wealth inequality hypocrite Bernie Sanders just took a private jet for a 10 minute flight,"[https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/02/29/ten-minutes/](https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2020/02/29/ten-minutes/)

Global warming hypocrite and wealth inequality hypocrite Bernie Sanders just took a private jet for a 10 minute flight

Bernie Sanders claims to be against global warming.

He also claims to be against wealth inequality.

But he just made both of those problems worse by spending his campaign donations to take a [private jet](http://www.theamericanmirror.com/claim-bernie-entourage-takes-3-private-jets-to-fly-95-miles-in-sc/) for a 10 minute flight.

What a hypocrite, and what a hypocrite!

I think the worst part about the left is...,"The double standards. 

They all flock in cities. The biggest cities. Where most of the pollution is yet they point the finger at us. We are somehow the problem in our little towns because we are the ones resisting making these massive changes for problems they created. 

They blame us for gun violence but in our small towns, a few people *might* get shot a year. It's not our fault that we dont want to give up our constitutional rights because they don't have any respect for firearms and have thousands of deaths a year. 

Their youth blame us for their economic failures in life but we dont really have those kind of issues in our youth. Sure there are a few who might get drug addicted and cant hold a job. But I dont know of anyone from my Highschool class who doesnt know how to get dirty and work hard enough to make ends meet. We just do what we have to do and not blame others for any shortcomings. 

I'm 23 and am honestly terrified of what our country will look like as I grow older and our people grow more progressive. I'm worried about someone trying to take my firearms rights. I'm worried about the economy crashing under liberal policies. I'm worried about crime rates rising due to a smaller job market and less incentive to work.

Ambassador Sondland: The Reverse Smoking Gun,"All you need to know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HaI0fVyFYg

(Hat tip to /u/theonecalledjinx for posting this transcript earlier)

MIKE TURNER: Ambassador Sondland, I want to walk through some of the portions of your testimony because sometimes, you seem to make direct connections and sometimes they seem to be dead ends. I kind of want to clear up what are the dead ends and what are the direct connections. Yesterday, ambassador Volker who I consider to be very talented and a man of integrity and I believe you think he's a man of integrity, correct

SONDLAND: I do

MIKE TURNER: He testified that The President United States did not tie either a meeting with the president a phone call or any aid to investigations of Burisma 2016 or the Biden's, that the president did not do that, and you testified that the President did not tell you that he tied them either correct

SONDLAND: I did testify to that although when ambassador Volker and I were working on the statement and negotiating with the Ukrainians it was clear to ambassador Volker that a meeting would not happen without the Burisma in 2016, that was very clear to ambassador Volker.

MIKE TURNER: And then, how do you know that, what did he [Volker] say to you because he says that was not clear to him in fact he says that's not the case he was working on that he knows that that's what the president wanted but he didn't have it as this was a requirement

SONDLAND: Oh, I strongly disagree with that portion of his testimony it was absolutely a requirement or we would have just had the meeting and been done with it

MIKE TURNER: What about the aid he [Volker] says that they weren't tied that the aid was not tied

SONDLAND: And I didn't say they were they were conclusively tied either, I said I was presuming it

MIKE TURNER: Okay, so the President never told you they were tied, so your testimony and his [Volker] testimony is consistent and the President did not tie aid to investigations

SONDLAND: That's correct

MIKE TURNER: Okay, he [Volker] also testified that he spoke to Giuliani and that Giuliani did not relate that the that he was tying on behalf of the President or on the president's behalf aid and then in fact Giuliani never said to him that aid was tied to investigations. Now I get the question I have for you is did you ever have a conversation with Giuliani that did not involve Volker because your testimony is a lot of “We’s” and “Us’s” so did you, do you Giuliani have a separate conference separate phone call where Giuliani told you that the aid was tied because Volker says, and if he was on all your phone calls, Volker says that never happened

SONDLAND: No, I did have a few conversations, I don't recall how many because I don't have the records with Mr. Giuliani directly when Mr. Volker wasn't available, (crosstalk), I don't believe I testified that Mr. Giuliani told me that aid was tied.

MIKE TURNER: Oh, I think see this is part of the problem Ambassador Sondland and I just want to walk you through this is you've said to us everyone was in the loop and everyone (no, no, hold on a second) I want to say I've listened to you today as a lot of people and not only our answer is somewhat circular frequently you've contradicted yourself in your own answer. Now the text messages and emails that you put up there, Kurt Volker walked us through it he has a completely different understanding of what you were saying, than what you're saying you were saying. So I'm a little confused as to how everyone's in the loop because …if Giuliani didn't give you any expressed statement then it can't be that you believe this from Giuliani now let me tell you right now because, is Donald Trump your friend?

SONDLAND: No, we're not friends

MIKE TURNER: Do you like the president?

SONDLAND: Yes.

MIKE TURNER: Okay, well you know after you testified Chairman Schiff ran out and gave a press conference and said he gets to impeach the President of the United States because of your testimony and if you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid” is that your testimony today Ambassador Sondland, is that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigations to the aid because I don't think you're saying that.

SONDLAND: I've said repeatedly, congressman, I was presuming, I also said that President Trump

MIKE TURNER: So no one told you, not just the President, Giuliani didn't tell you, Mulvaney didn't tell you, nobody, Pompeo didn't tell you, nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations is that correct

SONDLAND: I think, I already testified

MIKE TURNER: No, answer the question, is it correct no one on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying this aid to the investigations because if your answer is yes, then the Chairman's wrong and the headline on CNN is wrong, no one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations, Yes or No

SONDLAND: Yes

MIKE TURNER: So…you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations

SONDLAND: Other than my own presumption

MIKE TURNER: Which is nothing…I mean that's what I don’t understood, so you know what hearsay evidence is ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me, do you know what made up testimony is made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean you're just assuming all of these things and then you're giving them the evidence that they're running out and doing press conferences and CNN's headline is saying that you're saying that President States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations and you don't know that, correct

SONDLAND: I never said the president United States should be impeached

MIKE TURNER: Nope, but you did, you have left people with the confusing impression that you were giving testimony that you did not. You do not have any evidence that the president United States was tied to withholding aid from Ukraine in exchange for investigations, I yield back.",Conservative,1574299577,CherryCokeNixon,50,1,True,2019-11-20

Reddit is allowing left-wing lynch mobs to get left-wing media attention in order to target right-leaning subreddits.,"#I am a whistleblower.

(Because we now know that legitimate whistleblowers DO NOT have to have any first-hand knowledge of a situation and sometimes hearsay can be more valuable than direct evidence.)

(I also immediately claim ""whistleblower protections."")

Over the course of the last couple of days I have done some research.

In the past, there was a very important adage in journalism.  You may have heard it.  It's an adage for life, too.

#""Consider the source.""

Does that ring a bell?  I thought it would.  Apparently Schiff himself outed the whistleblower.

[Warning, the article herein contained includes the whistleblower's name as it appeared in Schiff's own documents and also links to other major media discussing the whistleblower.](https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/10/schiffs-committee-published-name-of-alleged-whistleblower-last-week/)

So what did reddit think of all that at the time?

#[On November 12th, reddit told NBC that they would NOT be censoring the whistleblower's name or discussion of the whistleblower on reddit.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/reddit-allows-alleged-whistleblowers-name-to-surface.html)

Okay, good right?  Because ""consider the source"".  Journalists were free to examine the whistleblower to determine whether or not he was likely a CREDIBLE source.

Boy howdy did some people have some questions.  Turns out he was an Obama appointee, hand picked by Brennan, who was CIA and placed in the White House.  He was kicked off of the [White House National Security Council because he leaked a false story to the New York Times saying that Putin made Trump fire Comey...but the CIA placed him *back in* The White House.](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2019/10/whistleblower_eric_ciaramella_is_this_the_best_theyve_got.html)

I mean...for me, that's enough.  No wonder people don't want you to know who he is.

Enter the moral arbiters of all that is socially just and the determiners of what kinds of speech are welcome on reddit and what must be EJECTED...the SPLC cabal of subreddits with the intention of SWEEPING reddit clean of all things they object to.

Obviously...againsthatesubreddits was VERY CONCERNED that people were talking about the whistleblower and they still are!  So are topmindsofreddit.  Redditors were so concerned about who was mentioning that name **that reddit said could be mentioned**...

[That someone actually made a thing for ""dataisbeatiful"" tattling on which subreddits were mentioning the whistleblower's name!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Digital_Manipulation/comments/dyydv7/rdataisbeautiful_oc_visualizing_where_the/)

Oh, and look there...r/politics was ALSO mentioning the whistleblower.

But then...SUDDENLY...with probably absolutely NO PROMPTING from anyone at all on lefty reddit...[because these people would never try to weaponize media against subreddits that they find distasteful....](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/ctxcbc/rconservative_user_shares_a_parents_full_name/exs6wtu/)

[No other than ***The Washington Post*** wrote a story about how big meanies on The Donald were talking about our hero whistleblower.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/dwvh01/washington_post_reddit_posters_on_rthe_donald/)


#Suddenly...

[The Donald was warned by the admins to stop talking about the whistleblower OR ELSE!  And the folks at Againsthatesubreddits are now ON THE LOOKOUT for any posts on T_D or elsewhere about the whistleblower*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/dypy4y/the_donald_has_been_officially_warned_by_the/)

(*unless they show up on r/politics in which case they probably will ignore because they wouldn't want to get their OWN political fellows in trouble.)

#As a result of reddit taking a bold stance against allowing The Donald to do what it had previously said it was going to allow...

https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/reddit-warns-the-donald-over-whistleblower/

Reddit has gotten GLOWING publicity from The Daily Dot.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/tech/reddit-trump-whistleblower/index.html

And CNN.

CNN cares VERY MUCH about doxxing, see.

[It's not like they'd ever doxx an elderly Florida woman who runs a Facebook group for Trump and accuse her of being a Russian asset.](https://www.conservativereview.com/news/cnn-doxxes-elderly-woman-claiming-unwittingly-helped-russians-election/)

Thanks, folks... for listening to my whistleblower's tale.

"Hi Conservatives! I'm trying to get a balanced view of the current Sondland debacle. The impeachment discussion thread here seems to be conservatives only though, so I'm creating this post. Hoping to have a discussion akin to r/changemyview","So from what I understand Sondland testified 2 things that the right and left have latched onto.

The left has latched onto the fact that Sondland thought there was a quid pro quo. 

The right has latched onto the fact that Sondland said Trump and co never said anything about quid pro quo. In fact he specifically stated no quid quo pro. 

\----------------

Since I'm coming from mainstream subreddits here's what I've gathered: (obviously left leaning) 

1. Just because Trump and co never explicitly said something, doesn't mean the intent wasn't there. As another comment I saw put: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There's a blue egg. Both Sondland and Trump see it. Trump says 'Hey Sondland, this (blue) egg is actually red'.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sondland confirms to Congress that the egg is blue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sondland also confirms to Congress that *Trump told him* the (blue) egg is red.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump is a liar, but both of Sondland's statements are true.

Someone could say this is mental gymnastics, but I feel like it's common sense to try be able to maintain deniability of anything sketchy. 

   2. I read that Trump said there was no quid quo pro to Sondland only after the whistleblower came out. Arguably, anything he said after the whistleblower is not really valid, because he's already (theoretically) covering his ass.

   3. The money was also only released to ukraine after the whistleblower complaint. Just because we released the money doesn't nullify the issue. 

   4. Even if there wasn't quid quo pro, that's not where the bar is. Even simply soliciting is considered a crime. The left has been saying the the GOP keeps moving the goal posts for validity. Additionally, apparently even holding money back that Congress has put forward is also a crime and apparently happened with Afghanistan too, but nothing was done about it at the time. 

\-----------------

**Is there something I'm missing? Are some of my points invalid? Please change my view!**

*Please no identity politics and trash talking news or liberals. It's not constructive and only serves to further divide Americans. I just want actual decent conversation between opposing sides to see where the gap in understanding lays.* 

*On a side note. I think it's counter-intuitive to have the discussion thread conservatives only. I understand the hesitancy because you want to limit brigading, but since other subs are left leaning we kind of need to head to other places to have discourse.

What is the defense going forward for Trump?,"Do you guys honestly think Trump did nothing wrong? Or do you just hate the process? 

This is the timeline from what I've gathered:

MAY 23rd – The Defense Dept certifies that Ukraine had met the US Policy requirements \[not trump’s later demands\] and that the it was OK to release the aid.  

JULY 25th -    Presidents Trumps official call with Zelensky as per the transcript.  Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, is notified by an employee in her department, Ukrainians reached out on asking members of her staff what was going on with the military aid. 

 AUGUST12 - Whistleblower complaint is filed with the intelligence community inspector general  

SEPTEMBER 9th - The inspector general wrote to the House Intelligence Committee on formally disclosing the complaint to Congress for the first time.  

Also on SEPTEMBER 9th - Trump’s phone call to Sondland stating:  “I WANT NOTHING.  I WANT NOTHING.  I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO.  TELL ZELLINSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING.  THIS IS THE FINAL WORD FROM THE PRES OF THE U.S.”   

SEPT 11 – Trump release the aid.

"Okay, I need someone to explain this to me, please.","tl;dr - I don’t understand how this video (https://youtu.be/_AHNEPqh2S8) summarizes today’s hearings when the entire 35:49 video only showed one pieced together sound byte discrediting mr. Holmes. I need someone to explain to me if this is really what people use for a news resource. 




I am an independent and I am watching the impeachment as a non biased viewer. I could argue both sides but that is not why I am here. I am not here to start any kind of problem. 

I have watched all 5 days of hearings in their entirety. I have listened to late night comedians, right wing news, left wing news, international news, and listened to various podcasts. I prefer to hear both sides of any argument and come up with my own conclusion.

I’m here because I was scrolling through YouTube watching my various view point videos and I stumbled upon this video: https://youtu.be/_AHNEPqh2S8 

It struck me as odd that the host was summarizing today’s 7 hour hearings in a matter of minutes. But the most peculiar thing to me was that the show never showed a single clip of Dr. Hill. How is that news? How does that inform me, the non bias viewer, what happened today? I saw a few times where the republicans (Jordan and others) got to speak their mind - but the video cuts back to the host and I never get to see the response. If I didn’t watch these hearings and solely watched this video I’d be completely against the impeachment as well. The only sound clip we got of Mr. Holmes was a small pieced together clip that of course made him look discreditable. 

I’m here on this page because I need some kind of explanation. Does anyone disagree and think this video is a valid source of news? That there’s nothing in here from the other side, how is that even news?At least play a clip and argue against it or something. 

I’ll repeat again, I’m not for one way or another but I am for giving the people quality information and this right here failed to provide that to its viewers. 

For those that answer respectfully I thank you in advance, we all want America to be great regardless of the road each side wants to take.

You can't convince liberal trolls your right. Challenge Accepted!!!,"I frequent as many of you do a small news website called. [Foxnews.com](https://Foxnews.com). This website unlike some more mainstream sources of news... like CNN allows you to not only read others opinions on the news. But actually express your own. 

As many of you know who have been there, the comment section tends to have two types of individuals. Anti-trump trolls, and everyone else. Today I was able to successfully convince one such troll ""TrumptyDumpty102"" that Confederate Civil War statues should remain up. 

All he asked for was what conservative groups have been offering all along. A descriptive plague giving historical context. Though his language on the matter was what you expect from a troll. He did agree. Considering his hundreds of anti-conservative posts, and his name... I am calling this a win. 

This goes to show you, that no matter how unlikely you think it is you can reason with liberals. Even the most far left and radical of liberal trolls, like ""TrumptyDumpty102"" have a chance of seeing reason. Keep up the good fight.

When he cums I bet he makes that same sexy little face when he’s listening to some stupid shit being said. After he’s glazed me like a Krispy Kreme, we’d likely enjoy a cigarette together, talking about how hot that just was. All the dirty talk with Tucker is probably gonna get me horny again! So I’d probably ask (politely of course) if he would pull my hair and ash his cigarette out on my neck as he’s sending slow, deep strokes into my little coin slot. Assuming he’s got enough charged up for a second load, I’d demand he cums on my face this time, and then I’d use the cum on my face to lube up his throbbing cock and make him cum a third(!) time, but this time, into my sexy little mouth. I want to swallow Tucker Carlson’s third load. I’ve earned it at this point. I want to fucking swallow Tucker Carlson’s third fucking load.

Discussion: Anyone else think the upcoming economic redline is similar to the 1929 rise in Germany? Democratic Socialism = Nazi regime anyone?,"So as the stock market is nearing a correction, the next steps are a recession then a crash. The signs are clearly pointing out that history will be repeating itself. 

As the Dems struggle to gain power with false accusations, internal corruption and a handful of ""Socialists"" wanting to gain power by brainwashing mindless Liberals, this is a close example of the 1929 great depression repeating itself. 

The Nazi's took power and all of a sudden our economy falls. Hmmm.. Seems the Dems have the same effect. They are the ones who call us Conservatives names, meanwhile they are just repeating the same behaviors of the Nazi regime. MSM, fake news and these censorship tech companies don't want to admit what they were taught in history class. Their (CNN, MSNBC, NBC, etc) feeling seems to be more important than facts. 

The major players (Warren (mind you was once a Republican), Sanders and the ""squad"", has clearly exemplified the exact behaviors and tactics as the Nazi party with their god awful accusations and deniability. They even have their own ""defenders"" ie: antifa and big tech.

Am I the only Republican who is sick of Trump’s shit?,"I never really liked Trump from the beginning, despite being a registered Republican since I turned 18. I knew he would be a total headcase if elected. I voted for Rubio in the primary and Johnson in the general in 2016 to try and keep Trump out. 

While the tax cuts are nice, and I like getting rid of bad trade deals, Mr. Trump has had too much drama involved to justify nominating him in 2020. This whole impeachment bit is icing on the cake. He’s been getting crazier and crazier. It’s like the Antonio Brown saga of the past two months, only multiplied times AIDS. Just a few of the problems I, as a Republican, have with him:

1. He’s boorish and generally shady. 
2. His comments toward Rep. Omar and others. While I vehemently disagree with Mrs. Omar, she is still an American and deserves to be treated as such. 
3. His cronies are no less corrupt than those of previous presidents. In fact, they’re possibly more. 
4. The Mueller investigation
5. Trying to circumvent Congress in appropriating funds for the border wall. As a constitutionalist, I believe that is a flagrant violation. 
6. Everything related to the impeachment proceedings of recent weeks. Even if he is innocent, he needs to focus on his defense and not fan the flames. 

He has severely damaged the Republican Party’s brand and crippled the organization for years to come. If Mr. Trump is allowed to run as a Republican next year, we will be handing the election to the Democrats.  

This is a call to all Republican Party officials: expel Trump from the party. We need to do this sooner rather than later so we can nominate a better candidate.",Conservative,1570029754,Strider755,0,1,True,2019-10-02

Seeing more hostile messages to the mods: Don't do it,"For some strange reason, I’ve seen an uptick in the rude comments and remarks in messages to moderators.  I don’t understand it, and we’re certainly not going to give a positive response.

First, let me say that probably 75% of rude messages to mods comes in the form of angry leftist trolls. They insult us personally; they say we’re stupid, or that we hate “free speech;” they generally the leftist troll that we all know and despise.  I’m not referring to them.  They are what they are, and that’s not going to slow down.

The other 25% are puzzling to me, because they are presumably people who want access to the subreddit, but are upset with us because they don’t have unbridled and open access from the very first time that come here.  The surprise isn’t the issue, but the attitude we get is.  This used to come in a slow trickle, but it’s increasing now, and it’s entirely unnecessary.

If you find yourself unable to get a comment through, *start by reading the whole message you receive*.  This is paramount because far too many people are whining and complaining about not being able to comment in /r/conservative, when they are only currently blocked from posts marked “Conservatives Only.”  We have hundreds of posts per day, and only a few are marked “Conservatives Only.”  It takes a couple weeks, and some evidence of good comments in the subreddit, but you can ask, and we’ll either give you flair or explain what more you need to do.  We might even approve the comment if it is merited.

All image posts are filtered.  We will not come off of this.  If you post an image, a youtube video, or a twitter post, it will be filtered for review.  If you try to make a self-post, it will be filtered.  They all will be reviewed for content and quality.  If we decline, we’ll tell you and explain why.  You can protest, but we are unlikely to overturn the decision.

If you have an account that’s under thirty days old or hasn’t met the **undisclosed** karma minimum, then *all* your comments will be filtered and you’ll need to have all comments reviewed and approved.  To expedite this, just send us a friendly message with the permalink to your comment, and we’ll get to it as quickly as we can.

We do all of the because **we have to**.  Leftist trolls would love nothing more than to destroy this subreddit, fill it with irrelevant and hostile posts and comments, and they don’t care how to do it.  So they’ll create terrible posts, from profane self-posts to literally gay porn.  This is not an exaggeration.  Mods have seen it.  Heckling, profane, or demeaning comments are the norm from the left, and even if they are banned, self-serving and entitled leftists are more than happy to break sitewide rules to create alt accounts and continue the harassment.

All that said, we’re seeing more and more people who *are not* leftist trolls send us disrespectful messages about our policies.  If you insult us, if you compare us to a leftist subreddit, if you say we’re against free speech, if you act like a troll, it’s all the same to us and it all violates Rule 1 of the subreddit: Keep itCcivility.  You are invited to contact us with questions or to ask us to approve something manually.  You are not invited to be a jerk, either in the subreddit or in message to mods.

I want to do my best to clear this up because it is entirely unnecessary to be so hostile to a group of people who are volunteering to maintain a subreddit that is constantly under attack, and if you think that attacking us for our policies is the way to go, you’ve got another thing coming.

What's the difference between temporary removal of one right VS another?,"So with all the talk about red flag laws, it has me wondering why confiscation of firearms is the right that is suggested to be taken away. First, in terms of escalation, if someone who is deemed enough of a risk that their guns are confiscated, won't that escalate their behavior? Won't they try to legally or illegally obtain different ones? What about guns that are not registered? There are plenty of older guns that are not recorded, so does that mean mandatory registration? How about private sales? 

Or will they move to some other device of destruction like a vehicle, explosive, etc. ?


If legislators feel like a person is dangerous enough to remove their second amendment rights, then why do involuntary detention? Or forced committal to a mental institution for observation? 

If proponents of red flag laws have an issue with the above, then then why should we entertain this idea for the second amendment?",Conservative,1565741795,LeeroyJenkins11,0,1,True,2019-08-13

Page 101 (442)

\- Giuffre clarifies what is and isn’t true in the statement. Donald Trump was a friend of Epstein but did not have sex with any of the girls or flirt with Giuffre. He also never told Trump “you got the life”

Page 195

\- DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by Epstein: § Ms. Maxwell “approached” Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was “fifteen years old” to recruit her into the scheme. § Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged girls for sexual activities.” § Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page6 of 66 7 § She “persuaded” Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children.” § At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms. Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” § Epstein “with the assistance of” Ms. Maxwell “converted \[Ms. Giuffre\] into . . . a ‘sex slave.’” Id. Ms. Giuffre was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” § Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” § Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she committed in Florida.” § Ms. Maxwell “participat\[ed\] in the sexual abuse of \[Ms. Giuffre\] and others.” § Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including \[Ms. Giuffre\].” Id. She shared the photos with Epstein. § As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect\[ed\]” Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these persons. § Ms. Giuffre was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in § “\[Ms. Maxwell’s\] apartment” in London. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” Ms. Giuffre’s § sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” § Ms. Maxwell “assist\[ed\] in internationally trafficking” Ms. Giuffre and “numerous other young girls for sexual purposes.” § Ms. Giuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.”

Page 234

\- Picture of Maxwell, prince Andrew drew and Giuffre.

\- Ms Giuffre travel records are incomplete, many examples. She was being flown by them without keeping records some of the time

Page 243

\- Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10.

\- A walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66 56 19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4.

Page 244

\- Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 306:24.

\- Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.

\- Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.

Page 245

\- Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.

\- Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was ""the boss"" and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.

\- Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein’s home. Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.

\- He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24.

\- **And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7.**

\- Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20.

Page 246

\- Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.

\- Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.

Page 264

\- Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm.

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.

\- the butler for Defendant’s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.

\- Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense.

Page 265

\- Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre – although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights.

\- Defendant’s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein – including 23 documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly together.

Page 266

\- The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.

\- Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein’s private jets – the – Lolita Express” – with Defendant at least 23 times.

\- Ms. Sjoberg’s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg’s school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein’s home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5 nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have to do it.

Page 268

\- Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.

\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre’s breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg’s breast.**

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons.

Page 269

\- Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:

Page 270

\- Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears – how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin’s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport.

Page 271

\- Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre’s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new momma.” 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.

\- Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police’s investigation of Epstein. He testified that Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein’s lawyer.

Page 272

\- Notably, at Defendant’s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein’s pilot’s flight logs.13

\- However, David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials – GM – was, in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with Defendant.

\- Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.

Page 273

\- Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.

Page 274

\- Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one – to testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex.

\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.

\- Another one of Defendant’s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre’s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s “new mamma.” Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in Epstein’s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified that she was Epstein’s procuress.

\- Others who lived with her – Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen – invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.

\- **Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile’s private jet all over the world.**

Page 275

\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre’s photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.

\- She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant’s house in London.

\- This photograph corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.

\- Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein.

Page 276

\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein’s New Mexico Ranch.

\- Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page22 of 74 15 warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be prepubescent.

Page 277

\- In 2008, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida identified Ms. Giuffre as a protected “victim” of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.

\- Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page23 of 74 16 Defendant and Epstein taking Plaintiff to New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York while she was a minor. The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.

Page 278

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice.

\- Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s abuser.

Page 279

\- Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.

\- Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates’ sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.

\- The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell’s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell’s denial of any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.

Page 280

\- Messages reveals that Maxwell, “GM,” took messages at the residence, including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein.

Page 282

\- One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for “work” explaining that she does not have any money. The term “work” was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from ”I need work. I mean I don’t have money. Do you have some work for me?”

\- Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe

\- Giuffre 001428 – undated Jeffrey From – “Has girl for tonight” ;Giuffre 001432 (pictured above)– 7/9/04 – Mr. Epstein From – “ is available on Tuesday no one for tomorrow”; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 – Mr. Epstein from – “Me and \_\_\_\_\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone” ; Giuffre – 001452 – undated Jeffrey from “Has girl for tonight.”

\- Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.

\- Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)– JE from “N” – “ hasn’t confirmed for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn’t call back; Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed \_\_\_ at 4 pm. Who is scheduled for morning? I believe wants to work.”

\- This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year old Russian girl for purposes of sex.

\- Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For Jeffrey From Jean Luc “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.”

Page 283

\- This message pad directly refutes Maxwell’s sworn testimony that she was not present during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion because this shows leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 30 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.

\- Giuffre 001412 – 9/10/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from – “I went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.”

\- These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from “Larry” demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein’s main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.

\- Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 – Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell – “tell him to call me”; Giuffre – 001449 – 8/22/05 – JE from GM; Giuffre – 001453 – 4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry “returning your call”;

\- This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.

\- Giuffre – 001454 – undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine – “Would be helpful to have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.”

\- This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to “stay in school.”

\- ” Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)– Jeffrey 2/28/05 Redacted name “She is wondering if 2:30 is o.k. She needs to stay in school.”

\- This message pad reflects a message from who was under the age of eighteen at the time she was going over to Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide sexual massages according to the Palm Beach Investigative Report.

\- Giuffre 001421 3/4/05 to Jeffrey from “It is o.k. for to stop by and drop something?”

\- These message pads reflect the pattern of underage girls (noted by the police redaction of the name on the message pad) calling the Palm Beach mansion to leave a message about sending a “female” over to provide a sexual massage.

\- Giuffre 001423 11/08/04 To Mr. JE – redacted from – “I have a female for him”Giuffre 001426 (pictured above) – 1/09/05 JE To JE from Redacted – “I have a female for him.”

Page 284

\- This message pad reflects the pattern and practice of having young girls bring other young girls to the house to perform sexual massages. Indeed the “ ” reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the ” that Tony Figueroa testified he initially brought to Jeffrey Epstein during the time period that the Defendant was requesting that Tony find some young females to bring to Jeffrey Epstein’s home. See Figueroa at 184- 185. The Palm Beach Police Report reflects that “ ” and “ ” also brought seventeen year old to the home to perform sexual massages. See GIUFFRE 05641. thereafter recruited a number of other young girls to perform sexual Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74 22 massages as reflected in the Palm Beach Police Report.

\- Giuffre 001427 (pictured above) – 1/2/03 – JE from “Wants to know if she should bring her friend with tonight.”

\- This message pad reflects multiple sexual massages being scheduled for the same day which corroborates Virginia GIUFFRE, and Johanna Sjorberg’s testimony that Jeffrey Epstein required that he have multiple orgasms in a day which occurred during these sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001449 (pictured above) – 9/03/05 JE from – “I left message for to confirm for 11:00 a.m. and for 4:30 p.m.”

\- This message pad shows a friend of Jeffrey Epstein’s discussing with him how he had sex with an 18 year old who had also been with Jeffrey Epstein.

\- Giuffre – 001456 (pictured above)– undated JE from Jean Luc – “He just did a good one – 18 years – she spoke to me and said “I love Jeffrey.”

\- Law enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of the names and telephone numbers in these message pads

Page 285

**The Black Book**

\- Palm Beach Police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with their phone numbers form Defendant and Epstein’s residence.32 Ghislaine Maxwell maintained a contact list in an 31 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 42:14-43:17; 78:25:-79:15. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page30 of 74 23 approximately 100-page-long hard copy, which was openly available to other house employees.

\- It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant. Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI.

\- This document reflects the numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers.

\- Additionally, and importantly, there are several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) – including – identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document.

**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**

\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein’s trash.

\- The books he ordered are titled:

(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;

(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude – Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy Baldwin; and (3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 – 2288. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page31 of 74 24

\- This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account of being sexually exploited by Defendant and Epstein – not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence contradicts that testimony.

Page 287

**Thailand Folder with Defendant’s Phone Number**

\- Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch.

\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.

\- Indeed, on the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words “Call Ms. Maxwell (917) !” on Virginia’s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.

\- The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre’s accounts of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant’s argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.",Conservative,1565795835,pinner52,42,595,True,2019-08-14

Sorority made a pride post on instagram,"My chapter posted a pride post on our Instagram with the caption, “All of us XYZ support LGBTQ.”  Personal feelings aside, do y’all think it’s ok for a sorority to post something grouping in all of our members? I would feel the same if it were any other stance, for example a pro/anti abortion law post. I know that it is difficult to be a conservative on a college campus, especially in the times we’re living in. My concern is not stemming from a position of hate but rather my belief that I don’t believe it is professional or fair for those who are not in support of LGBT, who are in this organization, to be represented by this instagram post. Additionally, I am worried that my father will see this post and become hesitant to pay my dues. Does anyone have any opinions/suggestions?",Conservative,1561491871,ato29,11,11,True,2019-06-25

Killers should not have their names and faces in the news or media (unless they are still at large),"With all the shootings, I felt like posting this. I feel like many of these shooters are so desperate for human attention that they will get it by any means necessary. They are literally killing to “make a statement”. They want everyone to know their fucked up message, and only their message.  We have people who praised bin Laden, although we had to let his name out because he was still out there.  We can’t let murderers think we will know their names and that they’ll be remembered.  Their messages and statements mean nothing if we don’t know who is giving them out, thus they fade into oblivion.  The killers should stay in our police records, not our history records.

Mexico winning this battle delayed the French from conquering all of Mexico just enough that the US Civil War’s momentum changed and the North won.

On creating a new social media,"I'm reading a ton about dissatisfaction with FB and Twitter, and I'm wondering what anyone would actually be willing to do about it.

Quick background: I'm a coder with the know how to actually create a new social media site, it's not that difficult, but to be honest I don't know if it would be worth my time (and I'm guessing any other programmers in this sub would think the same thing.) So I was just wondering how much you all would actually be willing to do to see FB get some serious competition.

1. Would you be willing to pay? Chances that advertisers would actually sign up, at least at first, are basically nil, and getting venture capital to actually start the process would be practically impossible. The site would need to keep itself afloat. And I'm not doing it for free (I'm a Capitalist, but I'm not rich either.)

2. Would you be willing to pay in digital currency? This would help prevent de-platforming if you could take credit card processing out of the equation.

3. Would you actually sign up, use it, and encourage others to do so? Not just other redditors, I mean your family, your coworkers, your friends.

4. Would you be willing to be eponymous, posting under your own name? Would you post pictures of your dogs and cats and kids? If you want anonymity, you already have sites to handle that. Any new site can't be purely political, that's too niche a market for anything to actually compete with Silicon Valley.

5. Would you be willing to submit to some reasonable rules of civility? Sites like Gab and Voat are cesspools, and will never gain wide acceptance.

6. What features would you actually want? Images? Articles? Videos?

7. Would you be willing to help police content to ensure that really crazy stuff keeps off the platform? I'm talking about ensuring porn, actual calls to violence and real actual racist content stays off. I won't make some site for ISIS and Stormfront.

8. Are you an actual adult? I'm not looking to make a site for a bunch of kids to get their lives further ruined by social media.

Honestly, I'm a free market guy, I see a hole in the market here, but I'm genuinely wondering if anyone complaining about censorship on FB and Twitter would actually be willing to go through making a switch rather than just complain.",Conservative,1557193809,turderer,9,6,True,2019-05-06

Kelsey Coin to become Official USA Currency by end of 2019,"This is an excerpt from a recent article posted by 21-year old self-proclaimed trillionaire tech entrepreneur Chris Kelsey:

Kelsey Coin has already become the world’s only currency. With that being said, the USA is the first country to recognize Kelsey Coin as its official currency. During this process, existing banking systems run by companies such as Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Bank of America, etc. will shut down.

One of the main concerns regarding Kelsey Coin’s future is system security as we don’t use illegitimate concepts such as blockchain. The truth of the matter is that it won’t matter. There are many different ways to ensure complete account security and we will take all required measures to do so.

Certain government sectors including the Federal Reserve will no longer have a purpose and therefore will be shut down entirely. I am not concerned regarding any potential “lost jobs” because Kelsey Coin will stabilize the economy so that petty work is no longer required. Automation of course will aid this process and we need to stop acting like these jobs are necessary.

It is very likely that a number of other countries will recognize Kelsey Coin as their official currency this year but the USA is the only country I can say for certain as of now. It is important to educate the world on how to use Kelsey Coin and its related platforms (World Home and Black Market World). I recently wrote an article that details everything you need to know about Kelsey Coin — here is the link. We will be keeping everyone up to date regarding upcoming Kelsey Coin news. In the meantime, I’m excited to be taking part in bringing such immense positive change to the world.",Conservative,1552693934,OmarPreston,0,1,True,2019-03-15

A rant about voting age,"When I was young and dumb I was once a stupid r/libtard full of optimism and hope, this glorious world around me was bountiful and ripe with splendour, there was no evil, there was no sadness, only spectacular opportunity. 

Then I got my first paycheck after working 40 hours and almost half of that was gone to the mystical and the mysterious government who would be using the fruits of my labor for the benefit of society... Ok, there's a lot of people out there that need this more than I do and I'm helping them. 

I was working for a lawyer who owned some rental property, I cut the grass and I did the manual labor necessary to keep the lawns nice and the lights working, I was helping people with everything I did. 

Then I started working in healthcare... I started as an EMT-B back in 1999 and we covered an entire city with primary 911 coverage because the bureaucracy failed and the fire department was insolvent after years of unfunded pension liabilities. Those who worked for years and paid into the union were left without any retirement or healthcare coverage, the lies of the ponzi scheme became obvious when the city lost ""revenue"" (tax money) when residents fled the blight for better jobs in better places. Enter the private market... The privately owned business which was beholden to those same taxpayers and Medicare and Medicaid paid 30% of the bill rate for services. 

I began to realize that the community was full of downtrodden and non contributing people, we were taking patients to doctors appointments because they were so unhealthy they couldn't walk. They were living in subsided housing, collecting 100% disability, getting food stamps which have no restriction on what's purchased, and calling us to take then to a doctor who's getting 30% bill rate for services and we're getting 30% bill rate for services provided by all those tax dollars they're taking from my paycheck.... 

Now, these individuals were on complete disability for absurd reasons like morbid obesity, mental issues related to stress, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, etc. But my paycheck was getting taxes taken out and giving the alcoholic the money to go down to the local bar and drink, my paycheck was giving the morbidity obesity patients the free will to go to the local grocer and buy whatever pop, candy, snacks, and unhealthy food they wished. Why? Why am I contributing to this viscous circle?

Then I woke up, I realized that the democrat party wants slaves. They want people that will continue to vote against any possible reduction to their ""free lunch"" because it's a game of buying votes without handing out $5 bills at the polls it's handing out $100 bills every month. Buying votes is illegal, unless you disguise that as constituents who are on the take and you run advertising every election that's warning those on the government (taxpayers) dime that some ""evil republican"" wants to take away your free lunch. 

You want to mobilize a giant number of people that are leaching off the system, tell them a conservative wants to end the ""free"" money they get every month and you'll get every drug addict and morbidly obese individual in section 8 at the polls.",Conservative,1552744156,sexymurse,28,108,True,2019-03-16

The people who want to ban guns have absolutely no understanding of guns.,"This is directed at everyone who's never held a gun, owned or even operated on but thinks they have the right to tell everyone else what they should and shouldn't own. Between the recent attack and Beto saying he wants to remove the sale of AR-15s I'm realizing that people are absolute morons with no knowledge of anything gun related. I knew it was bad but the recent events have made things far more apparent. Some common things I noticed that we're incorrect

The reason this ban is scary is because you don't have a definite guide to what it is youre banning, you're merely saying, i don't like this one, let's ban it.

You aren't banning it on caliber, on deadliness, we won't even get into magazine size as Oregon is now pushing to limit all guns to 5 rounds. There's no other reason to ban it other than the fact it's widely used and has been popularized by the mainstream. Undoubtedly the ban of the AR will only lead to another gun with the same specifications being used in mass shootings and the precedent that a gun can be banned for no specific reason will have already been set, hence the slippery slope.

Controversial but unclear claims/statement,"Hi r/conservative, I'm a research assistant (in Germany) and I'm currently working on a project about semantics in politics. More precisely, the project is about political statements which get lots of attention but are actually not as clear as it initially seems.

&amp;#x200B;

A good example from Germany is Merkel's famous ""Wir schaffen das.""/""We will make it."" in context of the refugee crisis of 2015. This phrase was cited and discussed for years, but Merkel was never asked what it precisely means? What is it what we want to make/achieve? What does it mean for citizens? And how should ""it"" be achieved successfully? (Similarly, ""The Islam belongs to Germany."" - Any kind of Islam? Only liberal Islam? ...)

I think transgender poeple dont want unisex bathrooms,"Transgender communities have passed legislature such as the Massachusetts Gender Identity Anti-Discrimination Initiative. This protects an individuals right to use the bathroom that he/she chooses in MA. But if and individual feels ""more comfortable"" in a bathroom because it is predominantly inhabited by a specific gender, wouldnt unisex bathrooms would take that away that comfortable feeling? 

The opposers of ballots like these probably dont want transgendered people to use a bathroom that differs from their assigned sex at birth. Transgender people may want to use a bathroom that differs from their assigned sex at birth. Its a case of want vs want

Why should legislature give priority to someone with a mental heath issue?

I personally dont care where someone goes to the bathroom. I would not oppose only unisex bathrooms for all future construction in my state. But, I think that the trangendered people who are fighting so hard for this bathroom issue would oppose it.

A co-worker and I fall on opposite ends of the political spectrum. She is a black liberal (though she claims to be moderate) and I am a white conservative.

We have both agreed to choose a book the other person should read and discuss them and I would like your help in determining that book for our side of the conversation. She has made claims such as: Black people can't be racist, You must be in power to be racist, every white person is racist, systemic racism is so baked into our society that black people can't succeed.

How the Media Pushes the Narrative,"It seems that every program on ABC/NBC/CBS etc. must include certain plot items:

1) LGBTQ character with extra points if they just came out.

2) Female law enforcement officer/FBI-CIA/boss who's fighting being marginalized by men with extra points if she's a victim of sexual assault.

3) Illegal immigrant who only came here for a better life - extra points for being LGBTQ &amp;/or a victim of sexual assault.

Classic example was over a couple of recent episodes of ""Bull"" (spoiler alert); Key female character is a former FBI agent. She's dating a guy who we presume to be Mexican? Latin? who works as a building superintendent. While the couple is out to dinner another patron of the restaurant collapses. Without thinking the boyfriend rushs over and begins medical treament but as the stricken patron stablizes and the siren is heard in the background, boyfriend informs the former FBI agent that they need to leave ASAP.

Jump to the next episode where we discover that boyfriend is actually an undocumented immigrant and the story gets the wings needed to sway the court of public opinion.

1) He was a famous heart surgeon in the country he fled - the country is never named.

2) According to him the educated in his country are a threat to their government and his best friend from medical school was assassinated in a public square! in front of his wife and kids!

3) Knowing he had to get out he paid an attorney ""all his money"" on the promise that he'd be accepted in the U.S. and be back practicing medicine in no time. Unfortunatley the lawyer duped him and all he got was a two week tourist visa.

4) After living in the U.S. under the radar for seven years, he's been caught and is facing deportation and certain death.

And on we go from there with more stereotypes - the overburdened, uncaring (and clearly Trump-appointed judge); the former FBI agent/girlfriend forced by the cruel judge to admit Dr. Boyfriend committed a crime and a daring rescue to ship Dr. Boyfriend to Germany where he'll seek asylum(because we know how well that's working out for Germany). All overlaid with repeated references of what a quality person Dr. Boyfriend is and what he brings to the table.

But here are a few questions that will never get asked or answered and the ommission of such which contributes to the average low-info voter buying the Democrat open borders line:

1) You came here on a tourist visa - what stopped you from seeking asylum during those two weeks? Why didn't you go to the U.S. Embassy in your home country and ask for asylum?

2) You've been here seven years - what exactly have you been bringing to the table as an under the table building super? In NYC - an all blue ""sanctuary city"" with free legal aid and numerous resources, you couldn't go legit?

Trump makes me feel bad to be a conservative.,"I know this is gonna get down voted instantly and I'm gonna get shit on for this opinion, but considering this is the conservative sub and not T_D, there should be some other reasonable conservatives who agree with this sentiment.

I'm definitely conservative leaning, mainly when it comes to the Constitution. While I may be more centrist in regards to social issues, I always identify with conservatives more than liberals. 

But Trump has just made it fuckin hard to be conservative. Talking about conservative ideals has become taboo, especially where I live in Denver. And that's even if I get past the inevitable shit-on fest from people asking how I could possible be a republican, vote for Trump, etc... (I'm a registered independent, didn't vote for Trump or Hillary).

Now at first I was on Trump's side for the most part with this whole investigation. It seemed like a last ditch power grab from the left and there is still no concrete evidence. I'm not jumping to any conclusions, but the Nixon impeachment took 6 years.

And Trump is making it SO. MUCH. WORSE.

His tweets, his rants, the way he talks to people in public. Ya he's different from your average politician, and he's shaking things up, but he's a fuckin asshole. Everything he says is attacking someone, blaming someone, etc. 

And the fact that he continually acts like there is nothing wrong with this entire situation, the fact that he tweets all night basically different versions of ""nothing to see here"" is starting to rub me the wrong way. 

The opinion of the US has been degraded so badly over the last two years, in part because of the horrible media dividing at any point possible, but also Trump being a hard headed dick. Yes it works sometimes, but other times it fucks us over. Look at the tariffs and GM. 

Maybe it's just media hype, maybe it's all the conflicting information making it so confusing, but I'm getting to the point where I really want to see where this investigation goes, as Trump *was* acting like a guy falsely accused, but now he's acting more like a guy trying to get his story straight.

I know I'm not the only conservative that feels this way. But it would be nice to actually talk to some who do.

Framing political opinions to be more palatable for liberals,"You need to use morality to effectively communicate your point.

You want lower taxes - you may want to lower taxes for all individuals and businesses, but saying you want more money doesn’t sit well with most. Sure it is reasonable and respectful position to you put not them. Instead of saying you want more money directly, you can say that you want more money to be in the hands of small businesses so communities can grow. Your emotional intentions are important to them. You have to recognize this.

With gun control, it is not reasonable to expect them to find agreement on something they know so little about (they want less of them, why would they ever learn anything about them in the first place?). Instead, point out the people and communities the laws affect. Show the gun control policies as a hinderance to the safety and representation to the most marginalized people and communities. Not as an unreasonable law that says you can’t buy a certain kind of your toy or tool for no good reason.

When wanting less illegal immigration or immigration in general, don’t dwell on the negative aspects that come with illegal or legal immigrants. Instead show that larger influxes of immigrants take up state and federal resources that could be used for the millions of citizens that need these resources as well.

Framing issues in the way that appeals to them is effective for explaining your positions and opinions to someone not likely to be sympathetic.

Thoughts on Trump's handling of Khashoggi disappearance?,"Hi all,

I'm a longtime lurker of several political subreddits and this is my first post, so bear with me. I consider myself a moderate. In general, I tend to lean slightly liberal on social issues and conservative on fiscal issues. There are things I like and dislike about both sides. On the dem side, as a white guy, I abhor the idea that being ""white"" is almost used a pejorative term these days and that I'm expected to apologize or feel guilty based on some perceived notion that I am somehow harming others based on the color of my skin. On the republican side, as a scientist, I am alarmed by the denial of many repub politicians of the overwhelming evidence of climate change.

A question regarding tax brackets,I’m pretty new to following politics in general and have typically avoided addressing super complex issues like economics because it seems like an infinitely intricate situation which no one can understand fully. However I do find myself leaning conservative on most issues both socially and economically. My question is regarding tax brackets in the 1950s vs now. There was a 90% bracket back then and it appears as though that’s the time liberals at the very least say republics yearn for. I don’t know whether or not that is true and that is really the core of my question. First of all do conservatives feel nostalgia for the economy of the 1950s and if so what is the opposition to the tax brackets of that time and why are those tax brackets considered anti capitalist when they weren’t then?,Conservative,1539790379,Reallyreallycoo,0,1,True,2018-10-17

Brennan voted for the Communist Party at the height of the Cold War in 1976 when the Soviet Union actually wanted to destroy America,"Obama’s former CIA chief, John Brennan, was a radical activist, who disclosed to the CIA that he had voted for the Communist Party at the height of the Cold War in 1976 when the Soviet Union actually wanted to destroy America. Therefore, it’s hypocritical for Brennan to call Trump’s warm behavior towards Putin an act of treason given that Brennan once effectively voted for Russian takeover.

I was arguing with a coworker about government regulation,"I work at a bank and everyone is complaining about the stupid regulations we need to follow that are redundant and I make the comment government should just get out of banking all together. To which he responds no, government needs to regulate businesses to an extent. Corporations are greedy and will harm workers. To which I responded “if I want to work for 5$ an hour why does the government need to step in?” Which he said well the corporation will force you to work those low wages. To which I said no I would choose to, and if a business only hired 5$/hr workers they will have worse products and no one will buy from them. He dismissed it and said if you think regulations are bad look at China where businesses do whatever they want.

What are your views on downvoting?,"I've noticed that a lot of leftist ""kids"" in here go on hatred filled downvote binges, either by gathering a group of people to do it, or going down your post list. I know because I see even the most innocent of my previous posts getting downvoted after I engage in a risky politics conversation.

It is a ridiculous behavior trying to enforce thought conformity or otherwise PC culture which is very much a fascist tactic the way I see it. So far it doesn't bother me cause I get about 1 downvote per 10 upvotes on average. 

For that reason, personally I don't even feel like returning the favor. Maybe one downvote click for some really aggressive users. That's about it. Sometimes not even that, because they cross the line from aggressive to plain comical.

Why leftists are more like Nazi’s than the alt-right,"Well as a brief overview of the current US political scene would show, there is a  great difference between the right and left sides of the political spectrum. But to cut the bullshit and the reason you are reading this (hopefully) is to either have confirmation of the way leftists operate their political agenda or your are a leftist yourself and want to hear what a “racist”, “bigoted”, mouth breather would say. To get to the point, the way leftist media and supporters of the left would argue is that anyone who isn’t a hardcore pro-choice civil rights activist is the second coming of Hitler. But to say that ICE and the Trump administration are Nazis would be extremely hypocritical and ignorant of what your side of the political spectrum is doing. Let’s start from the most prominent act of Nazism that the left uses; propaganda machines. These “media outlets” push their political goals and agenda down viewers throat and are essentially propaganda outlets for people who don’t know better. Much like Nazis they have promises of a better America for the minorities and leftists who have lost individuality and have confirmed to a solely group ideology. They make claims that if the left gets control of the US it will be a safe haven for everyone that sides with their viewpoints. This is similar to the Nazi promises of a unified German state  by promoting the few that actually agree with the ideology. Another way is through the use of loaded language and lies to create a feeling of outrage and anger. I won’t mention any specifics due to the crazy nature of these types of platforms but everyone knows those “relatable” anti-Trump websites that use fake data to sway the gullible and young American people. Examples include the use of School Shootings to promote gin control instead of respecting the people involved in a tragedy or completely legal and peaceful pro-Trump rallies and showing them as groups of hate. The way this relates to the rise of Nazism in Germany is because they both use propaganda that pictures the parties as victims and as people who are serving justice to others while really just trying to push a political agenda. And for the crux of the argument that the left is using Nazism ideals to try and sway the masses is the way the try and vilify the Trump Admin. and white people, most notably white men. This is what the left used to convert the right wing of America. They use downright racist tactics and embellish stories to try to make these groups seem like the evil ones. This can be seen a while ago when the talks of separation of children from immigrants was used as a weapon against the Trump Administration. On the other hand the left uses white Americans as a scapegoat for everyone else’s problems. Let me give an example a minority woman goes to an interview. She doesn’t get the job. Instead of thinking of ways to improve and get a job, she vilifies the white majority and government and claims that it’s their fault for being white and racist. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out but this targeting of these groups of people is exactly like Nazis blaming their problems on Jews even though they did nothing wrong. And the fact that it’s a social norm and acceptable to do this is just disgusting and hypocritical to the extreme. Now I will admit this is biased. As a conservative and right winger I will try to make the opposing side seem awful but if your truly want to see the truth do research and see the logic and parallels for yourself. Then make your decision. But based on that the hypocrisy in the left is absurd and should be more denounced by true Americans. As a send off. as to not get this post removed unfairly, I will say that I am not calling anyone or any party a Nazi. I am just showing the parallels between the two. I will also say that I respect the political views of the opposing side, even if they are wrong.",Conservative,1531164788,TrashRider,2,1,True,2018-07-09

It's place for tracking the more violent, unhinged, radical, type rhetoric being thrown around these days.

They often try to back pedal and delete posts once they garner enough negative attention.

My goal is to give a centralized place to keep track of what these nut jobs are saying.

Question from a new redditor,"I am a relatively new redditor and wanted to ask a question here to get more information. I made a new account because I did not want to mix politics with my main account, as it is usually very divisive. 

I am new to politics. As I’ve gotten older I’ve realized I need to pay more attention to what is really going on in the country. Obviously I’ve found out that almost all media is left-biased so it’s hard to know what is truthful on the web. My question is what exactly are trumps ties with Russia and what exactly is going on with the investigation. I’ve tried to google and get more information but most if not all say that he has ties with Russia and that they must be “colluding” but they must all be subjective pieces because he wouldn’t still be in power if it was proven like they say.

Can somebody enlighten me on the situation with actual facts? I’d like to gain more awareness about what’s going on politically but I need real answers not based on emotion.

What I Realized about America,"As a Christian who is constantly discriminated against by Americans on the left for a while I thought I hated America and America hates me. Not too long ago I realized though, those people hate America. The people who want to kill babies, outlaw Christianity, call mental illnesses normal, accept mass migration, and censor me. They openly claim to hate America and say they want America to fail. The values this country is founded on requires us to be upheld. The left may be citizens of America but they are not Americans. They want to outlaw Christian values the country was founded on and outlaw Capitalism the most successful system in human history. This is why regardless of race, background, or even country of origin, it is our job as Americans to protect this successful system. We protect the entire world, we are the new Rome. Without our defenses and trade the world would fall apart and we can’t defend if we outlaw guns, accept mass migration, don’t protect woman’s rights in a **scientifically reasonable** fashion not what a teenager tells you to believe. An important thing is that we need American men and woman to become just that, men and woman. The trend of American beta males has to end, we should put down our video game controllers, think about moderation, and become hard working, exercising, brave, charismatic, courageous, intelligent, moral, strong men. Woman need to also be brave, charismatic, courageous, strong, caring, and most importantly need to stop third wave feminism. I think another thing we need to be successful is to stop having sex until after marriage so that we are not permanently poor and to stop idolizing woman as this makes us weak, cowardly, and stupid, all men care about today is sex, the same for woman actually. Babies must be made after marriage. This will make Americans bold strong **ADULTS** and will help put sane people back into the spotlight.

On how to expose my liberal GF into conservative ideas,"This post most likely belongs to r/relationships, but I consistently get bashed and shamed if I post such a thing anywhere except here, which is why I’m doing it here now. 

As you can read from the title, I have a liberal, feminist girlfriend that I want to expose conservative ideas to. I believe she has values (somewhere in the very deep) just as much as I do, but she’s grown up in a liberal environment where she was told what’s right and what’s wrong. I was born into a totally non-political family, but I chose to become a conservative myself.

When I talk to her about what she believes in, not trying to change her opinions, just to understand her logical process, she changes the topic immediately and sometimes goes as far as making weird noises to distract me. She agrees that every decision we make has to be logical, yet she doesn’t want to talk about even the possibility of something being the way she doesn’t believe it to be. 

Now is not a problem as I don’t care what she thinks as long as she doesn’t go out and change genders or something, but later as we get more serious this will become a problem. I’m also willing to change if she has any logical arguments that strikes me as sensible, but that is rather unlikely because I have thought about these issues for more than 6-7 years whereas she hasn’t thought about it much.

How do I make her listen to me, and make her understand the logic and values that are behind conservatism without her running away from me? How should I go about it, what should I say? Has anyone accomplished this before? Thanks in advance.

I am 100% convinced that these articles are virtue signalling garbage.  Given the course of the investigation and its scorched earth tactics, the point of the whole exercise is to build a case for impeaching trump.

"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: April 1, 2018 Edition","Clinton Offers Proof that Trump Is Hurting Economy

As proof that Trump's policies are bad for the dynamic sectors of the economy that prospered under Obama, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cited her drastically reduced speaking fees. In a speech at Rutgers University in New Jersey this week her honorarium was only $25,000--$7,000 less than reality TV star Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi from the show Jersey Shore received from Rutgers for a 2011 appearance and $175,000 less than Clinton's typical asking price before the 2016 election.

""The few thousand dollars in crumbs being awarded to middle class workers as a result of the tax cut legislation are dwarfed by the severe hardships inflicted on those of us who have to rely on speaking fees just to keep putting food on the table,"" Clinton complained. ""My 'wage' has been cut by nearly 90%. An economy that treats its best and brightest so shabbily is a discredit to the nation.""

The pay cut coming after what Clinton described as ""my traumatic loss to the least qualified person to ever win a presidential race adds injury to insult. I'm hoping that voters will remember what I've had to suffer through and punish the Republicans at the ballot box. If we all work hard we can turn back from the unbridled selfish individualism that the GOP wants to force down our throats and renew the commitment to the progressive values of collectivism that President Obama tried to establish during his all-too-brief reign.""

Congresswoman Blames Lack of Training for Harassment

Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn) apologized for failing to protect female staff members from harassment by her former chief of staff Tony Baker and blamed ""lack of proper training"" for the abuses, which included allegations of ""punching"" and ""death threats.""

""Much to my dismay, I discovered that punching and threatening staff members is not explicitly addressed in any legislation,"" Esty said. ""I will attempt to correct this, but can't promise anything since Republicans control both houses of congress. Meanwhile, of my own accord I will be requiring all my employees to complete training in harassment. Hopefully, this will move punching and threatening out of its current 'gray area' status and substantially reduce its frequency in my office. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be as aggressive as I am in combating this problem.""

An unmentioned element of Esty's ""aggressive"" handling of the problem was to recommend Baker for a job at Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit organization that was started after the deadly 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Esty's current chief of staff Timothy Daly explained that ""the job recommendation and nondisclosure agreement were aimed at getting Baker out as quickly as possible with a minimum of negative publicity. If the Congresswoman had merely fired him who knows what kind of impact that would've had on her credibility and reelection chances.""

Retired Judge Calls for Repeal of 2nd Amendment

Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens penned an op ed for the New York Times in which he argued that the Constitutional Amendment protecting a citizen's right to bear firearms should be repealed.

""When we examine the circumstances under which the 2nd Amendment was adopted it seems clear to me that it was unnecessary on the day it was adopted,"" Stevens wrote. ""At the time, the United States was less than a decade removed from a desperate battle for independence from a government that oppressed those living in what were then British colonies. One of the tactics the British government used was to strictly control and sometimes confiscate firearms. In fact, the battles at Concord and Lexington in 1975 were sparked by fears that British troops were about to confiscate the colonists' guns.""

""By 1789, the British overlords had been defeated and expelled,"" Stevens continued. ""It was replaced by a government by, of, and for the people. Those running this new government were elected by the people. Consequently, there were no longer any grounds for fearing a tyrannical foreign power would oppress them. The need for every man to be armed was no longer present. It seems likely that even in the absence of the 2nd Amendment that people's government would have permitted those who needed firearms to hunt or fend off hostile Indians to possess them.""

""Today, the vast majority of Americans live urban lives,"" Stevens went on. ""The need to hunt to obtain food is nonexistent and the Indians no longer pose a mortal threat. Meanwhile, the widespread ownership of personal firearms complicates the government's ability to police society. If the 2nd Amendment were repealed the government would be liberated from this archaic infringement on its authority. Under our democracy, the government is the people. There is no risk of oppression and every need for the government to set sensible limits on who has access to guns.""

President Trump branded Stevens' op ed as ""foolish and poorly conceived. Individuals' bearing arms serves as a check on the power of government to do them ill. In countries where the citizens don't have this right the government can ride roughshod over them, like Hitler did. You'd think that the Democrats who frequently compare me to Hitler would be wary of removing citizens' ability to deter government tyranny. Luckily, the people of America are too smart to surrender this right. The 2nd Amendment will never be repealed.""

In related news, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Fla) have introduced legislation to restrict access to ammunition. ""Our bill will require that firearms users file a form requesting permission each time they want to reload their weapons,"" Wasserman-Schultz said. ""While this wouldn't totally prevent victims from getting shot it will reduce the number of people that could be shot by each gun. If our bill had been in effect prior to Nikolas Cruz's rampage it would have been limited the number of bullets he could've fired to a single clip. He wouldn't have been able to kill 17 people.""

DNC Deputy Touts Minimum Income Idea

Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn), deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, endorsed the concept of government paying a minimum income to all citizens regardless of whether they work or not.

""A lot of things that people do don't have a market value,"" Ellison argued. ""For example, as a Muslim, I am obligated to pray five times a day, go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and wage jihad to spread the faith. As a member of Congress I have a generous salary and a small commitment of time I have to put in to earn this salary. Others aren't so fortunate.""

""What we need to ask ourselves is whether we, as a society, should force a person to try to support himself by taking a low skilled job if it would interfere with his other higher priority obligations,"" the Congressman posited. ""Wouldn't our lives be more meaningful if more of us were freed of the drudgery of wage slavery so we would be able to pursue these higher priorities?""

""A guaranteed minimum income might also assuage the justifiable anger many feel at the inequitable distribution of wealth in our country,"" Ellison added. ""Ideally, everything ought to be put into a common pot and divvied out based on need. But we're not there yet intellectually or politically. The minimum income idea is a baby step toward that ideal.""

Dershowitz Criticizes Mueller Probe

Liberal Democrat lawyer Alan Dershowitz likened the Mueller probe into the Trump presidency to the type of legal tactics of the Soviet Union. ""First off, 'collusion' is not a crime defined in statute,"" he observed. ""On top of this, the mandate given to Robert Mueller by Rod Rosenstein is unconstrained. Essentially, Mueller has been granted an unlimited budget and an unlimited amount of time to harass Trump in search of something to charge him with. This isn't the way we want our justice system to work. It's the way Stalin's 'justice' system worked.""

Dershowitz maintains that ""after a year on the job without finding evidence of any criminal activity by Trump the prosecution ought to drop the case. Signs that Mueller is now seeking to investigate Trump's finances and sexual liaisons from long before the 2016 election are clearly what judges would label a 'fishing expedition.' Not only are the statutes of limitations long expired on any alleged infractions, we're now into the 'manufactured crimes' of obstructing investigations for which there is no warrant for being undertaken.""

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) disagreed with Dershowitz, contending that ""sometimes existing law doesn't adequately anticipate the crimes persons may commit. If we know a person is a bad actor we shouldn't automatically preclude even the methods that may have been used by a regime that has been repeatedly sullied as a dictatorship. Remember, that 'dictatorship' was instrumental in defeating Hitler. So, clearly, that dictatorship was capable of doing the right thing even if its methods didn't match America's normal standards of justice.""

Chicago Mayor Rejects Poll

A recent poll indicating widespread disappointment with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's performance was rebuffed by the Mayor who vowed to ""fight to the bitter end to transform this city and make it worthy of the vision of a great and progressive society espoused by former President Obama.""

Among the polls findings was that only 18% of respondents said they would vote to reelect him vs. 34% saying they would vote to replace him and 36% saying they would consider voting for someone else. Sixty-nine percent said lack of ""an honest or trustworthy city government"" was a major problem with the Emanuel Administration. Eighty percent said they felt less safe than they did two years ago.

Emanuel's campaign spokesman Peter Giangreco dismissed the poll. ""It's from the same pollster the Mayor sent a dead fish to a few years ago,"" he reminded. ""The people of this city know that the Mayor will do whatever it takes to stay on top. He is a master at exploiting crises for political advantage. Those who challenge him do so at their own risk.""

Madison Councilwoman Objects to Armed Bank Guards

After one of her constituents was killed while attempting to rob a bank, Madison, Wisconsin city councilwoman Amanda Hall called the shooting ""unnecessary"" and demanded ""an alternate approach. What this looks like to me is we have a young man, who didn't have the community support and the community opportunity to make a different choice with what he was going to do with his Thursday. And now he's dead.""

""Allowing banks to deploy armed guards is a desperation measure that comes too late to achieve the best results,"" Hall contended. ""It foments an arms race between those who have money and those who need it. We could go into the question of whether any business has a moral right to use deadly force to impede the redistribution of wealth this country so urgently needs. For now, though, I'm saying that as a practical matter it would be better to ban this practice and replace it with a more humane approach.""

This ""more humane"" approach, according to Hall, ""would entail educating and politically activating both the general public and young people to use their efforts to redistribute wealth via the political process. The fact that the bank involved in this shooting has been repeatedly robbed shouldn't be used as an excuse to arm itself. It should be taken as a sign that there are inequities in the way that those who have can callously withhold from those who have not.""

The Councilwoman says she hopes that ""we can use this tragedy to enlist voters to opt for social justice at the polls. If the have-nots of our society can have confidence that the government will seize the assets being hoarded by the haves and redistribute them more fairly they won't have to take the individual initiative to rob banks themselves. With the law on their side the whole process would be more peaceful and just.""

An indication that Hall's message is in tune with wider social trends is the Millennial generation's lack of saving for retirement. Only a third have expressed any interest or intent to provide for their post-work years. As one young man explained, ""capitalism will be gone by the time I'm old enough to retire. The government will control all the money. They will decide who lives and who dies. I'm just trying to have a good time while I can."" Surveys show that half of Millenials spend more on nights out than they do on rent and devote the majority of their income on impulse purchases based on social media fads. And why not? In New York City, the deBlasio administration has budgeted more than a billion dollars to house the homeless in hotels.

Census Plan Assailed by Democrats

The US Census Bureau's plan to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census spurred an outpouring of deranged rhetoric from assorted Democrats and their allies.

Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, incorrectly portrayed the plan as an attempt to ""only count citizens"" and contended it is a ""voter suppression"" strategy. ""Combined with the Republican insistence that voters show IDs before they can cast a ballot, the citizenship question strikes at the very heart of the democratic ideal that every person—citizen or not—have a say in who rules over him.""

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman vowed to lead a multi-state lawsuit aimed at stopping the added question. ""Why does the federal government need to know who is or isn't a citizen?"" he asked. ""Since a person doesn't have to be a citizen to get a driver's license, to get medical care, to go to school, or receive welfare benefits the answer to such a question serves no legitimate public purpose.""

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the question ""an attack on our state's right to grant sanctuary to those in the country without permission. Once word gets around that citizenship will be questioned the undocumented immigrants will avoid census takers and not be counted. The state and the urban areas where most of the immigrants live will get fewer congressional districts and Democrats will lose votes in the House of Representatives. This both illegal and unconstitutional.""

In related news, Utah senatorial candidate Mitt Romney kicked off his campaign with the assertion that he is tougher on immigration than President Trump. ""Trump is totally focused on keeping illegal immigrants out,"" Romney observed. ""Well, we can't win if we only play defense. If elected I will push for legislation to award grants for Americans to illegally enter Mexico and create the same kind of mayhem there that many of those who've illegally crossed into the US have caused here.""

[Fox](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/88n3jn/sinclairs_script_for_the_local_news_stations_that/?st=JFG6T2UU&amp;sh=e37f74e9)

There are some things here that I do not understand, likely because I’m young and ignorant. Why does the world seemingly hate Fox News? Reddit wants to see Fox’s building burnt and its leaders imprisoned. Some good friends of mine that are center-left constantly make Fox the butt of jokes, essentially saying it’s biased and thus unreliable. Fox seems to be the only one deserving of the “Fake News” label according to the Internet. Obama even made comments that one should not trust Fox News. I don’t understand why.

Yes it’s got a right-leaning bias, but I don’t think they try and hide that do they? And even still, they seem to fairly report things regardless of which side it seems to favor.  What’s most baffling of all is why are people so willing to ignore the left-leaning bias of every other news station? 

I don’t often watch Fox News and honestly I don’t pay attention to much of the news at all, its just frustrating to see all this hypocrisy and everyone losing their minds over Fox. Every other station has scripts, they all collude, and people (the internet? Reddit?) only care when it’s Fox doing it because that, along with right-wingers, are the “greatest threat to our democracy,” (someone actually said that in the comments.)

The constant demagoguery of the left,"So to keep this short, what experiences have you all had since the election with trump regarding family members and how do you deal with it? My once close cousin now considers me a danger to her family due to my vote. im also on the wrong side of history, support an evil man. She simply wants nothing more than to blame and rail against me. She claims to want to ""understand my support"" for him, but insists on being rude and disrespectful. How can anyone have a civil conversation with someone like that? 



Such hysterics do not belong in politics. I refuse to brand anyone i disagree with as evil. i refrain from absolutes. I am a big Michael Medved fan and, like him, insist that ""evil"" be reserved for the truly deserved.

My question is, how do you folks deal with it, and what suggestions/debate tactics work the best with such hyperbole. As the saying goes (im paraphrasing of course), debate isnt meant to convince your opponent, its to convince your audience. I can't avoid her. i simply cannot. Family gatherings make this impossible. So, in order to convince everyone else how nuts she is, what should i do? What do you guys do? Her main go-to is hate crimes and how i made her family unsafe (shes in a mixed family). shes a middle aged upper class white woman. in academia. the most privileged of us all. she oftentimes tells me to use my privilege to fix things. Shes a poster child for the left. She also likes to rail against ""hypocritical evangelicals"" and their ""hypocritical support for such a vile man."" How does one convince her otherwise? 

I am tired of being blamed for voting policy over personal. I'm tired of being treated like im a danger to society. im tired of the hysterics. How have you all managed?

I believe universities have lost their atmosphere of an intellectually challenging place where you can bring your ideas and be challenged and challenge others and come out of it with a stronger opinion or a changed mind.

/r/Conservative Banner Contest!,"Well, now that April Fools is over, it's safe to make announcements that half the audience won't automatically dismiss.

We've had our beautiful, masterpiece of a banner for quite some time now. Since [I'm not very good at making banners](https://imgur.com/Vp9LML3), we thought it would be fun if our next banner came from you, our loyal subs.

Submissions that will be considered must meet the following guidelines:

 - Must be 1600x327 (to match the current)
 - Nothing cut off by subreddit decorations and such (no one is beheaded by our Snoo, etc)
 - Must resemble something to do with patriotism and/or conservatism. Bonus points for both.

**How do you win?**

Submissions are now active through the rest of the week. Please vote on the submissions as they come in. Saturday morning the mod team will lock the thread, collect the highest voted and each mod can also nominate their favorite, as means to elevate new submissions. Based on mod votes/user votes, we will present the top 3 for the users to vote from. Saturday/Sunday the mods will convene to tally the votes. On Monday we will sticky another thread with the top 3 (and a brief on why they are there). The users will vote on that for 24 hours and a winner will be declared.

**What do you win?** 

Your art is on display for the rest of Reddit to love and appreciate.

"I don’t know why I’m here, but I’m really struggling with my leftist politics and really need to talk to some conservatives about how I’m feeling","Once upon a time I truly believed in left politics. But now I just see it as them just playing politics. Not different than any other type of politician of course, but you have to understand that I thought we were on the right side. I started getting politically active when I was 18 in 2004, when we invaded Iraq. I found it simply unjust that we were fighting there with no evidence they were related to 9/11. I still don’t. But my naïveté equated that to the Democratic Party - despite lots of its politicians voting for an Iraq invasion - was simply morally superior. We were on the right side and that kept me going.

Please note that I am black and trans. This is relevant only in so far that I just felt that I naturally had to side with the left on all things because “they fight for and with me”. It shaped an idea in my head that traditional values, things like that wasn’t for people like us because people who expose that mentality are “the enemy”. 

Fast forward to election 2016. I witnessed all the smugness, all the self righteousness, the idea that we alone contain the progress of humanity on our back blow up in our faces. All whites people are racist? Deplorables? I witnessed people blame all white people for voting for Trump when the blame laid at the feet of Hillary Clinton and her teams hubris. Not stepping into Wisconsin until it was too late, not caring about core Democratic states because they were mostly rural and therefore not important, only caring about coastal elites. Then I witnessed people laughing and not showing empathy to coal workers with black lung because of the simple “crime” of voting for Trump. Then and there I realized the things I believed in, the things I fight for were all a lie. We weren’t truly “better”.

I want to apologize on the behalf of any liberal or leftist who has judged you, who has hurt you, called you names or dehumanized you. As the months roll by I see myself questioning so much of what I was taught. I’m now a Christian, pro-life, and celibate. I will be confirmed as a Catholic this Easter. 

I’m not sure why I’m writing all of this. As much as I’m disillusioned with the current left I don’t find the current right a real alternative either. Yet more and more I start to see the value in good, hard conservative values. I’d like to say I need some help but I’m not sure with what exactly. I want to know how we can do better. How we can further understand each other and love one another.

Sorry this was long.

Do you know like-minded people offline?,"Hello, made an account just to join in here. This is something that's been on my mind for a while, and has really begun to bother me. I'm eighteen and it seems like all my peers are made from the same 2018 cookie-cutter. Liberal, pro-choice, sex-positive, anti-gun, atheists who think things like modesty and gender roles are evil. I, on the other hand, am the exact opposite of almost all of that. The scary thing is I know very, very few people my age who think the same. My own best friend thinks I'm brainwashed and doing what my parents tell me to do when in reality, I may be even more Conservative than them because I'm more passionate about it, and I'm more modest than my mom!


There are some things happening that it seems like I'm in 1% of with my opinion. For example, as a woman, I 110% agree with Nikki Haley's words on the sidebar. I'm apparently the only female in my life who believes these women's marches are absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary, and putting your toddler daughter in a p*ssy hat is absolutely vile. We're talking dozens of my classmates and family members and acquaintances rallying for something that I find truly appalling. Same scenario with pro-life or basically any topic that there's a Conservative side to. 


It's a very strange and lonely feeling. I'm not trying to find a radical Conservative corner because extremists in anything are a little much. But I don't think I know anyone younger than 30 who shares any of my beliefs. That's especially off-putting because, to be frank, I'm not going to date a liberal boy.

We all know his stance on the Soviet Union, and communism, and his leading the free world to rally against the “evil empire” and push back its expansion.  Finally ending with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Wall.  A fifty year Cold War ended with firing a shot.

Trust me, I could go on, the man is a hero.  I’m not just saying that, he did save 77 lives.  Then there was the “Battle of Hollywood” too.

List of all companies giving bonuses or investing so far because of the Tax bill.,"So far: 

**Comcast** - $1000 bonuses to 200,000 employees, and $50 billion to new infrastructure and investments in the next 5 years. 

**At&amp;t** - $1000 bonus to 200,000 workers and investing $1 billion in the next year. Though they apparently laid off 600 workers right after. I read into it because I was disappointed, it seems like they are going to move them to different departments if they can. Since the workers they laid off were in areas where their departments were in decline, while in other places increasing. They plan to hire in MO for example 1000 workers (around there), since they see an increase. So idk if it's laid off, or if they are going to move them to different departments to work. It seems like they were talking like that, but only time will tell. 

**Fifth Third Bancorp** - $1000 bonuses to 13,500 employees and set a $15 minimum wage.

**Wells Fargo** - Raised minimum wage from $13.50 to $15.

**Rush Enterprise** - $1000 bonus to all employees. 

**Associated Bank** - $15 minimum wage to workers from $10, and a $500 bonus to all hourly non-commissioned employees. Apparently this is a raise and a bonus to over 55% of their workers.

"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: December 24, 2017 Edition","Dems Appalled by Corporate Response to Tax Cut Bill

This week, Congress passed and President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The measure reduces taxes on corporations from 35% to 21% and on 80% of taxpaying individuals by smaller percentages. Democratic rhetoric attacking the the legislation predicted a ""massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich"" that would lead to ""Armageddon"" and ""the end of the world.""

Contrary to these predictions, the immediate response by numerous corporations was to announce widespread employee bonuses and plans for substantial increases in investment and hiring. AT&amp;T says it will pay $1,000 bonuses to 200,000 employees. Wells Fargo said it will raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, and make $400 million in donations to community and nonprofit organizations next year. Boeing, Fifth Third Bancorp, and Comcast each announced additional investments.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) labeled these actions ""an unfair exploitation of a socially unjust law for purely political gain. The notion that private companies should be the ones deciding whether employees get raises or bonuses rejects everything the President Obama was trying to achieve. And the idea that corporations should be the ones determining how much to invest or whether to make charitable contributions is anti-democratic.""

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) called the legislation ""fundamentally unfair. The 50% of Americans who currently have no jobs and pay no income taxes get nothing from this bill. It is a thinly veiled trick to try to compel those who are not in the workforce to give up their free time and get jobs if they want to get a tax cut or corporate bonus. This stinks. The GOP will pay dearly at the polls next November for this cruel tyranny over the most vulnerable segments of society.""

Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló contends that ""the money this bill gives to corporations and taxpayers is the rightful property of the poor. And none are poorer than Puerto Ricans. Our island is bankrupt and in greater need of these scarce resources than the businesses and individuals who worked to produce them."" Rosselló vowed to ""mobilize every Puerto Rican voter to elect the kind of representatives and senators who can be counted on to expropriate the profiteers and redirect money to support programs that benefit the poorest among us.""

Meanwhile, New Jersey Governor-Elect Phil Murphy (D) says ""the legislation is unconstitutional because parts of it are hand-written."" The irony, of course, is that the original Constitution itself is entirely hand-written.

In related news, Bureau of Labor statistics showing the lowest unemployment rate for Blacks in 17 years and the lowest ever for Hispanics greatly dismayed Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) characterized it as ""just more evidence of the complete failure of the Trump Administration to solve the nation's economic problems. Minorities that previously got along without having to endure wage-slavery were herded into the rat-race by Trump's maniacal destruction of unnecessary regulations. We are clearly headed for dark times in this country if we don't take the necessary action to neutralize this enemy of freedom.""

Evidence of Presidential Obstruction of Justice

According to a report published by Politico, former President Obama blocked the Drug Enforcement Agency's efforts to stop the Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah from developing a global narcotics syndicate. The nominal rationale for this intrusion to thwart a law enforcement operation was ""to not upset delicate negotiations with Iran."" Hezbollah is largely funded by the Iranian government.

Ben Rhodes, former Deputy National Security Adviser during the Obama Administration, characterized the revelation as ""Monday-morning 'quarterbacking.' Are we supposed to be shocked that a president might place a higher priority on reaching a diplomatic agreement with another country ahead of a routine and less important criminal case? Is the relationship between Hezbollah and Iran really our concern? I mean, it's not as if a successful prosecution of Hezbollah's drug smuggling would have solved the drug problem in this country.""

Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian-American council, questioned ""the presumed link between President Obama's quashing of the drug investigation and the negotiations with Iran. Just because the Iranian government funds Hezbollah doesn't mean that it could not be trusted to adhere to whatever agreement was worked out regarding its nuclear program. The sums the US government was willing to pay Iran for the agreement far exceeded the potential profits from drug smuggling. The President could've had other valid reasons for stopping the investigation.""

Former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf insisted that ""any claim that President Obama would ever try to obstruct justice is incomprehensible. His commitment to social justice was far ahead of any of his predecessors. My best guess is that he might have wanted to shut down the DEA investigation because he believed that Hezbollah was driven to crime and terrorism by discriminatory hiring practices in this country. I would be willing to bet that subsequent to his intervention many of the members of Hezbollah were given jobs somewhere within his Administration.""

Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) were not impressed by these efforts to exonerate the former president. ""Regardless of whether one considers the agreement with Iran on its nuclear program a good or a bad idea, I don't see how letting a criminal gang of drug smugglers off the hook could have been crucial or necessary,"" Jordan said. ""If Iran was making that a condition for obtaining its agreement I think that would be a pretty big 'red flag' that they couldn't be trusted. If it wasn't a condition we have to ask ourselves what reason could the President have had for butting into what ought to have been a normal law enforcement activity?""

In related news, Rhodes tweeted ""I look forward to the day when I can read a Post story on Trump's indictment and then flip to the obits page to see that Ryan, McConnell, and Pence have checked out.""

New Developments Further Discredit Trump Dossier

In private testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe couldn't remember anything about the dossier or where it came from. Neither could he recall ever having discussions with Strzok or Page on the topic of the election or Trump.

Christopher Steele, the former British spy who previously asserted that his dossier proved there was collusion, now says that ""the limited intelligence I have only indicates that such collusion may have been possible. Obviously, given the communication technology available today it's possible that everyone has the means to collude with anyone who has a phone or a computer. Since both Putin and Trump have access to both we can't definitively say that they didn't collude.""

Mary Jacoby, wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, bragged about her husband's ""creativity"" and proudly claimed that ""the whole Russia collusion story wouldn't have ever existed if it were not for my husbands efforts."" The ""efforts"" seem to have mostly entailed rehashing a gossip piece that Simpson and Jacoby wrote for the Wall Street Journal ten years ago.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif) dismissed the possibility that the accusations of collusion between Trump and Russia could be undermined by these developments, saying ""the seriousness of the charges is what ought to concern every American. Until someone proves there was no collusion we must proceed on the assumption that there was. Practically everyone I talk too is convinced that there is something suspicious about Trump's election. Every poll showed him losing big time. The only logical explanation is some sort of dirty trick. I have no doubt that such a thing could have taken place. It's too risky for us to allow a devious and dangerous man like Trump to ride roughshod over the rights of the American people on the flimsy pretext that he is innocent until proven guilty.""

UN Rebukes US for Embassy Move

First, the United Nations Security Council voted 14-1 to rebuke the United States for its decision to move the US Embassy to Israel's capital in Jerusalem. Later, the UN General Assembly voted 128-9 to condemn the US decision. Voting with the US were Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, and Togo. Major US allies like Britain, France, Germany and Japan voted against the US.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel explained that ""seventy-five years ago Britain, France, Russia, and the United States ganged up on Germany. Now the shoe is on the other foot. Let's see how Mr. Trump likes that.""

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki said the UN ""passed an unprecedented test. History will remember those who stand by what is right. With the whole world aligned against the Zionist occupiers and their Satanic ally the day will soon come when a final solution to the Jewish problem can be accomplished.""

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, was undaunted by the the UN's action. ""Each nation chooses its own capital,"" Haley declared. ""There is no moral basis for denying Israel this prerogative. Neither is there one for denying the United States the prerogative to respond as we see fit. The unseemly alliance of the anti-Semitic states who would evict every Jew from Israel and the effete Europeans who would acquiesce in such an injustice will not overrule our own best judgment.""

For his part, President Trump welcomed ""the unmasking of these ingrates. Not so long ago Europe was overrun by Nazi invaders. Then the United States did the right thing and came to their aid. Israel is surrounded and besieged by enemies. Now we are coming to their aid. If this displeases the UN—well, we can save a lot of money if we stop subsidizing them.""

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif assailed Trump's stance as ""a demonstration of his contempt for democracy. The representatives of the vast majority of the people of the world freely voted to condemn the United States for its attempt to impede the elimination of Israel. For Trump to use financial extortion to try to influence us is tyrannical. He has no right to withhold the wealth that rightfully belongs to everyone for any reason, much less as an inducement for us to reject Allah's command to rid the Earth of unbelievers, especially Jews.""

In related news, in Illinois, Cook County commissioner Richard Boykin has asked the UN to send peacekeeping troops to Chicago to help quell the gun violence that continues to set new records for fatalities. Pointing out that ""most of the victims are blacks killed by other blacks,"" Boykin maintains that ""our mostly white police force doesn't have the kind of ethnic understanding required. If we can get African troops to patrol our streets I think the outcomes will improve.""

Ethical Confusion at the University Level

Osaka University's Kazue Muta alleges that the princes in Snow White and Sleeping Beauty were guilty of sexual assault. ""Stories about kissing a comatose person without her permission promote sexual violence,"" Muta said. ""This is the wrong message for children to hear. These men had no right to force themselves on these women. A better lesson would be a story where these men respect the women's right to be left alone.""

The University of California San Diego is weighing whether to impose disciplinary sanctions on Gregory Lu, a student who who put up posters of Kate Steinle (the young woman shot to death in 2015 by Jose Inez Garcia Zarate--an illegal immigrant) with the caption ""she had dreams too."" Che Lopez, an investigator with the University's Office for the Prevention of Harassment &amp; Discrimination, called the poster ""possibly a 'hate crime.' Let's not forget that Mr. Garcia is a member of a legally protected racial minority."" At the same time, Lopez declined to even look for the students who tore down and ripped up the posters because ""we can't suppress freedom of speech.""

In related news, the University of California Los Angeles hosted a ""Muslim American Workshop"" where participants proposed policy suggestions that would help Muslim Americans. Among the suggestions were ""banning anti-sharia laws"" and ""eliminating First Amendment protections against hate speech."" One participant explained that ""Muslims won't truly be free in this country until they can live under their own laws and prevent unbelievers from openly criticizing them.""

Sarah Huckabee Sanders delivers the excellent Tax System Beer Analogy to the press,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/31/sarah-sanderss-questionable-argument-that-paying-taxes-is-like-buying-beers/?utm_term=.dcdba210a57e

If you haven't seen this analogy before, here it is:

---------------------------------------------------

**The Tax System Beer Analogy**

Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this…

* The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing

* The fifth would pay $1

* The sixth would pay $3

* The seventh would pay $7

* The eighth would pay $12

* The ninth would pay $18

* The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59

So, that’s what they decided to do.

The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve ball.

“Since you are all such good customers,” he said, “I’m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20″. Drinks for the ten men would now cost just $80.

The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men ? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share?

The bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man’s bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.

* And so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving).

* The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% saving).

* The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% saving).

* The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% saving).

* The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% saving).

* The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% saving).

Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings.

“I only got a dollar out of the $20 saving,” declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man,”but he got $10!”

“Yeah, that’s right,” exclaimed the fifth man. “I only saved a dollar too. It’s unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!”

“That’s true!” shouted the seventh man. “Why should he get $10 back, when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!”

“Wait a minute,” yelled the first four men in unison, “we didn’t get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!”

The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.

The next night the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn’t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!

---------------------------------------------------

**A few thoughts:**

This analogy is bang-on. I don't think Huckabee Sanders' delivery was very good, but it was nice to see this idea explained to the press and to the left (but I repeat myself).

Naturally, the response across the MSM and Twitter was to berate her and to make all sorts of jokes about beer, but in all the coverage I've seen, I haven't actually seen anyone refute this analogy. People love to criticize and attack and insult, but most commentary I've seen on this story showcases that the left doesn't understand the analogy and/or has no rebuttal to it, so they just mock Huckabee Sanders and sweep the analogy under the rug.

Either way, the mere fact that conservative principles like this are even seeing the light of day in the press is a massive improvement from the complete blackout of anything resembling conservatism that has existed in the mainstream over the past 30 years. I dislike a lot of things about the Trump administration, but things like this absolutely deserve to be lauded.

This is the single most fundamental economic lesson that the left doesn't understand,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLr2if-BdA4

I love that video. It's a 6 year old clip from Andrew Klavan and it's what got me into Klavan in the first place. It's so simple but so fundamental to everything that's wrong with leftism.

The foundation behind modern leftist/socialist ideology is the fact that the left doesn't understand what money is. They don't understand why it exists or what it represents. To the left, money is like a natural resource. There's a certain amount of it in the world, and if John has a lot, that means that Dave will only have a little. So to remedy this and make things ""fair"", we have to take some from John and give it to Dave.

That view is the root of all of leftist economic thought and it inherently doesn't understand what money is. This short Andrew Klavan video does a great job of explaining what money actually is and what it represents.

I've gotta say, that video, along with [this clip from a couple years ago on The Ben Shapiro Show (39:45 to 44:50)](https://soundcloud.com/benshapiroshow/ep63) are two of the greatest economic lessons I've ever heard because they're so simple and so fundamental to the entire leftist-conservative economic debate. It's because so many people don't understand these basic lessons on money and on income inequality that we see so many people seduced by socialism and the language of ""fairness"". Because of that, I think these are two great starting points to teach our left wing friends about economics.",Conservative,1509678189,heyyoudvd,102,111,True,2017-11-02

Googling autocomplete stops when Dan Rather memogate scandal terms are entered,"Hello all,

I recently read an article in National Review about Dan Rather's 'memogate' scandal from the early 2000s [memogate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy).  

I dimly remembered it so I decided to Google it.  When I did so, I noticed something curious about Google's autocomplete.  After entering ""Dan Rather scandal"" or ""Dan Rather resign"" or ""Dan Rather memo"", Google's autocomplete stops.  Could this be some form of censorship on the part of Google?

I've experimented by adding words that don't really have anything to do with Dan Rather like ""Dan Rather golf"", ""Dan Rather Superbowl"" and ""Dan Rather kittens"" and the autocomplete continues to work.

I'm normally not a tinfoil hat wearer, but I find it curious that the one thing Dan Rather is most known for in the 21st century doesn't show up in Google's autocomplete.  You do, of course, get relevant search results once you type ""Dan Rather Scandal"" and hit 'enter'.

Equal Pay Equal Work: Data w/o the correct interpretation.,"I was perusing subreddits looking for info to sticker bomb my water bottle. One subreddit was dedicated to handing out free stickers where a post was giving away an ""Equal Pay Equal Work"" one. A majority of those who responded said that the meme was mostly a lie and a false societal narrative. Maybe there is hope? Then there was one chap who went full-retard. Here's what he said: https://www.reddit.com/r/freestickers/comments/5pw4pz/free_equal_pay_for_equal_work_sticker/dcvomii/ (then there's always a person who says, ""Preach!"" at the end. Always.)

Here are my thoughts -

&gt;Uh, okay - reddit as a group tends to both be against any feminist ideas, incapable of going beyond surface level thought(ie, Equal pay act passed therefore equal pay is a solved problem, and ignoring every other externality), 

Since you worship data so much (w/o insightful analysis) here's a 2015 poll that asked redditors who'd they vote for in the 2016 election: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/43pdux/reddits_political_leanings_in_2015_oc/ Sanders and Clinton had won in a landslide. Given that both candidates could be said be pro-feminist or at least champion the saying ""Equal Pay Equal Work"" to say that ""reddit as a group tends to both be against any feminist ideas"" is quite the broad brush. The last time I heard reddit tended to lean either left or libertarian. Ironically, the poster is ""incapable of going beyond surface level thought."" 

&gt;and we tend to be so absolutely convinced of our own infallibility that we refuse to acknowledge any evidence or expert opinions to the contrary, instead preferring to try and nitpick them apart, using any small perceived problem we can find, no matter how irrelevant to dismiss it.

Expert opinions are just that - opinions. They may be more informed than the layman but that doesn't mean the lay cannot think for themselves nor does it mean that the expert is infallible. What the poster is doing is an appeal to authority. 

Again, the irony here (which he is fully unaware of) is that he and others appeal to ""external"" factors when saying that equal pay for equal work hasn't been achieved despite the passing of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 yet when people who question economists who say that the pay gap is real aka women are paid less because they are simply women, aren't afforded the same intellectual legroom. Since the expert with lots of numbers and ""data"" says so it must be true, especially when it comes to inequality. It must.

&gt;Okay, I'm being facetious, I know that's not what you meant. What I'm talking about is that it's pointless to argue for those reasons - the current consensus among most academics with any sort of grounding on the topic is that the wage gap exists, but reddit absolutely will not acknowledge it.

Yes, the wage gap does exist. But how wide is the gap? That's the question. There is a wage gap between me and by brother. I work in social work while he works in finance. There's a wage between that new female nurse and her boss, the female nursing director. And what's with this speech saying that reddit, as a whole, won't acknowledge the gap? It's a site with as many different subreddits as there are genus of flowers. It's like some sort of desperate insecurity of recognition, like many other grievance parlor games ... 

&gt;They(The economists) don't agree that there's a smoking-gun reason for it, or even what the biggest cause might be out of all the causes typically cited, but they agree it exists. 

And yet here you are going on as if the wage gap is some grand systemic injustice. I mean, if there's not equal outcome then there must be something wrong, eh? 

&gt;And then when people come along who are not only genuine experts, but are the foremost experts on the topic, like Claudia Goldin - a harvard economist who has spent a career studying the problem - we dismiss her because we sneer at her expertise because she describes her specialty as ""Gender economics."" I've even seen people go as far as claiming that economics isn't a real science, because it's not one of the traditional STEM sciences, and therefore can be dismissed out of hand.

Again, appeal to authority. This is not saying that Goldin's data is wrong (I've skimmed over her stuff and it seems correct, the data that is, but her data is similar to Thomas Sowell's data -- it's just that one, Goldin WANTS to find sexism within the difference while Sowell attributes the differences due to life choices), but her interpretation of the data could very well be in error. And this weird hard-on for Harvard people ...

&gt;And don't get me started on reddit's instance on controlling out every externality that causes the actual problem - yeah, two people in a high paid job might get paid the same, but we demand that you ignore how much harder it can be for women to get those jobs compared to men of exactly equal qualifications. 

Again, the poster speaks as if reddit, the site itself and its moderators, are in some grand conspiracy or something. So now we move from wage gap to politics of job attainment .... Pick one to talk about please because they're two separate issues. My external causes for the wage up, though not exhaustive are as follows (in no particular order):

education

amount of years in the work-force, whether full or part-time

amount of years in experience

&gt;We claim that women don't negotiate, which on the whole is true, but then ignore the fact that when they do, they tend to get penalized where men get rewarded, which provides a huge negative incentive. 

This is a very simplistic and incomplete way of looking at the differences. To think that women and men approach wage negotiation the same way is naive and, within the approach, lies the key to getting a higher wage. It's like asking a girl out on a date. It's also a numbers game: if less women negotiate there will be less negotiations; out of those that negotiate to think that a small percent will get what they want is just foolish. 

&gt;We claim that it's down to choices, and then ignore the forces that all but force people's hand when making those choices.

It is down to choices. I mean, is this poster daft? It's like he wants it both ways. Not once has he acknowledged whatever force ""that force people's hand when making those choices."" Is it sexism? Is is the so-called patriarchy? C'mon. He blabs on w.o. saying much of anything.

&gt;To cut it way back down to the simplest possible form: The gender pay gap exists, but reddit is so dedicated to the idea that it doesn't, and reddit's own intellectual infallibility, that it's pointless to discuss in most places on reddit, because people will do whatever they have to to confirm their opinion that it doesn't. 

And the poster is so sure that the wage gap exists and it's a sign of ... I don't know. He never tells. If he needs a space to talk it I'm sure there are plenty of subreddits in existence to vent his BS (like what I'm doing here haha!) but it seems he's unaware of this.

&gt;And that's why I'm telling OP not to bother. And please, if you want to argue, don't waste your time typing it - I'm answering your request, not looking for an argument, and won't give you one.

Not sure what the poster's politic leaning is but he sure sounds like juvenile leftists I've encountered. ""Ugh. A bigot/sexist/racist/xenophobe/LGBTphobe. I can't waste my time with you!""

Any good Music/Podcast services that cover ALL views? Spotify is terribly biased.,"I'm not a huge fan of having 8 different apps on my device because in my opinion that's 8 more companies tracking everything I do.

I LOVE Spotify... except when it comes to podcasts. I listen to a variety of news/opinion, and although ALL (seriously, I couldn't find one I regularly listen to that wasn't there!) of my left leaning sources are there, I can't find a single one of my conservative go-to podcasts. They have playlists for banned artists, a special section in podcasts for those banned from bathrooms, black lives matter playlists etc.... which I'm cool with being there, whatever... except there is nothing (and I mean NOTHING) on the other end.

I worry about supporting precedents like when Apple went full out banning every app with the confederate flag (even when used historically) from the app store.

It's their choice to espouse an image of liberation from censorship while doing the opposite in practice... but I don't want to give my money to such a one sided company. Does anybody know of a good music and podcast subscription service (or a combo of apps that works for them)? I'd like to limit it to two apps max.

Mozilla founder ousted for conservative political donations. Creates better browser to replace Firefox.,"**The Witchhunt**

On March 24, 2014, Eich was promoted to CEO of Mozilla Corporation. Gary Kovacs, John Lilly and Ellen Siminoff resigned from the Mozilla board after the appointment, some anonymously expressing disagreements with Eich's strategy and their desire for a CEO with experience in the mobile industry. Critics of Eich tweeted to gay rights activists that he had donated $1,000 to California Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California before being struck down in 2013. Eich stood by his decision to fund the campaign, but wrote on his blog that he was sorry for “causing pain” and pledged to promote equality at Mozilla. Some of the activists created an online shaming campaign against Eich, with online dating site OkCupid automatically displaying a message to Firefox users with information about Eich's donation, and suggesting that users switch to a different browser (though giving them a link to continue with Firefox). Others at the Mozilla Corporation spoke out on their blogs in his favor. Board members wanted him to stay in the company in a different role.

On April 3, 2014, Eich stepped down as CEO and resigned from working at Mozilla; in his personal blog, Eich posted that ""under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader."" Andrew Sullivan said of Eich's departure that ""there is not a scintilla of evidence that he has ever discriminated against a single gay person at Mozilla"" and the episode ""should disgust anyone interested in a tolerant and diverse society.""  Conor Friedersdorf argued in The Atlantic that ""the general practice of punishing people in business for bygone political donations is most likely to entrench powerful interests and weaken the ability of the powerless to challenge the status quo"".  In an article for The Huffington Post, Michelangelo Signorile objected to those arguments and stated that ""like Donald Sterling, [Eich] believed one group of people to be inferior to others, and he made it known to the public, since political contributions are now considered speech in addition to being actions. And, as the face of the company, he stood by that speech when asked to clarify it.""

**New Beginnings**

Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, an Internet security company which has raised $2.5 million in early funding from angel investors.The company's co-founder is Brian Bondy, who worked on Firefox and Khan Academy. The company's employees include Marshall Rose, a network protocol engineer, and Yan Zhu, who worked on SecureDrop and Tor.

On January 20, 2016, the company released developer versions of its open-source Brave web browser, which blocked ads and trackers and included a micropayments system to offer users a choice between viewing selected ads or paying websites not to display them. A recent update added inbuilt integration of 1Password and LastPass password managers.

UK Labour party and Scotland question / discussion.,"Hi,

I'm a 20 year old right-leaning voter from Norwich South and I was wondering what people's thoughts were on the upcoming election in relation to the SNP and Labour.

Recent polls have suggested that Labour are ""surging"" (which I don't believe for a second since the ""Green Surge"" turned out to be nothing), but my question is, what do you all think Labour's chances of coming out on top this election without winning back seats from the SNP?

In my personal opinion, I believe that the recent buzz around the Labour party is false media like that found with left-wing news outlets before Trump's win, but I'm concerned that the Tories may not maintain a majority of seats in the commons.

Bret Weinstein on Joe Rogan podcast,"I really wish that we could have a decent argument here on Reddit in r/politics or something about this, because I'm sure most of us agree: Just wanted to state Bret Weinstein's experiences at Evergreen University in Washington prove that the hard Left is intellectually dead. Quick recap: he protested a ""day of absence"" where it was demanded by student groups that white people stay off campus for a day. Bret refused and is being dragged through the mud for it.

I'm tired of even hearing about things like this from colleges but they never stop. This is the latest in a long line. Rogan got some great interviews out of him and this is the main reason for the post.

"Hi r/Conservative, can you suggest some conservative political podcasts to a liberal?","I know this has been posted here before, but a lot has changed since then and I have some specific requests.

**TLDR; Gimme a right-leaning podcast that talks about the news weekly(ish) in a rational way. The hosts can't be adamant Trump supporters (sorry, I just can't).**

I'm a former conservative (4+ years ago) and still sympathetic to some conservative views, but all of my current media sources are either moderate or left-leaning. I want some right-leaning stuff thrown in to complete the spectrum. There is a lot of news liberals and conservatives miss out on by only listening to their own side of the argument.

I've listened to some Glen Beck recently because I heard he's gotten more rational over the years, and I liked a lot of what I heard (even though I didn't agree), but his radio show is like 5-parts commercials to 1-part substance. Podcasts are almost all substance, so that should work better. If he had a podcast, I would probably listen to him.

I'd like a podcast with conservative leanings that is as rational as possible. Among other things, that means the hosts can't be adamant Trump supporters. They can be sympathetic to a lot of Trump's conservative views, but I can't see myself taking anything they say seriously if I know they approve of him. Also, the podcast should preferably be weekly(ish) and talk about the week's political news.

Edit: clarified ""Trump supporters"" a little

*Here are a couple of my favorite political podcasts if any of you are interested:*

* NPR Politics Podcast - Mostly moderate, just delivering the news without much commentary other than talking about what each piece of news means, and what effects it will have. 
* Pod Save The World - Mostly moderate, slightly left-leaning - A podcast strictly about foreign policy, hosted by people who work (or used to work) in U.S. foreign policy. The regular host is a democrat, but foreign policy has much less partisanship than you would think. He has conservative hosts on often and they seem to always be on the same page. 
* Lovett or Leave It - clear liberal bias - I listen to this podcast because it's really funny and I like the host (Jon Lovett) a lot. He's pretty rational and very often critical of democrats. Some of his guests say some more radical things sometimes that you will roll your eyes at, but don't worry, I roll my eyes at those parts too.",Conservative,1496768438,justinterlocutor,12,1,True,2017-06-06

"Russia: Not a Republican, but is everyone losing their minds?","Hello everyone! 

Personally I'm not a Conservative. I know quite a bit about politics, but I've never been very interested in it, and didn't even vote in the last election.

I do have a good BS detector however, and thought the Russia story sounded kinda dubious at first. It didn't really make any sense.

Of course more and more have been coming out, much of it stuff that contradicts other stuff on Russia. And in all cases it's the same kind of stories. Anonymous sources reporting on something that can't be verified, and minor stuff that suddenly gets blown up across the front page.
(Kushner trying to set up a backchannel is a good example. It's a minor thing that's fairly normal. Heck, Kennedy did the same before he became president, but looking at places like R/Politics, you'd think President Trump had just openly admired to molesting kids.

Is it me, or have Democrats really lost the plot?!? Like, it seems they've totally lost their critical thinking or gone clinically insane.

People I know who aren't into politics either don't care about it: ""How's Russia going to make the economy better?"" or don't think it's a big deal: ""So they tried influencing an election? And? Don't tell me CIA has never done that!""

But most: Is say 2/3 of the Democrats I know have swallowed it hook, line and sinker and seem to expect a new president next week. When they see someone doesn't share their enthusiasm they pretty much melt down.

Jeezus, what's going on with them? Is it something in the water?
And most importantly how will this end? 

I can't imagine they'll manage to impeach or get rid of the president without any proof, but sometimes I think they might just be able to pull it off.

But here's the most likely scenario. Trump is still president in a year, and there's no proof of collusion with Russia. Surely people will go back to not being batshit crazy then, eh?",Conservative,1496797613,Yrguiltyconscience,2,5,True,2017-06-06

"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: April 16, 2017 Edition","Merkel Explains Terror Policy

Facing a tough reelection campaign, German Chancellor Angela Merkel struggles to convince voters that her open borders approach to Muslim immigrants hasn't been a disaster. In an interview published in a German magazine this week she insisted ""we will never accept terror.""

Some of her critics have contended that ""admitting millions of Muslims is a defacto acceptance of terror."" Merkel rebuffed this criticism, saying that ""last year only 22 Germans were murdered by Islamic immigrants. In a population of 80 million this is a minuscule casualty rate. Considering that the fear of being attacked by Islamic fanatics has deterred many Germans from unnecessarily leaving home, it's possible that more lives were saved by having fewer traffic fatalities than were lost by these murders. So, clearly, terror does seem to have some potential positive offsets.""

""My bigger concern is that Germans are not reproducing at a high enough rate to replace those that die of old age,"" the Chancellor lamented. ""These immigrants will solve that problem. Their willingness to bear children will more than offset our birth dearth. Surely, the loss of a few dozen individuals at the hands of the terrorist portion of the immigrants is not too high a price to pay.""

""I urge all citizens who are concerned about their safety to do what I do,"" Merkel advised. ""First, forego all unnecessary travel. For the occasions in which this is not possible, beef up your security detail. Never travel on public transit. Always ride in vehicles with bulletproof glass and body armor. Avoid public places like shopping malls, theaters, stadiums, parks, schools, libraries, and the like. Shop by phone or the Internet and have your purchases delivered whenever you can. Have a member of your domestic staff run all errands outside the home. In short, if you are sensibly cautious your chance of being murdered by a terrorist or a common criminal should be acceptably low.""

In related news, some migrants are sold into slavery before they reach Europe. Since the Obama Administration liberated Libya from long-time dictator Qadaffi in 2011 the successor government has established slave markets to dispose of non-Muslim migrants entering its territory on their way to Europe. The Department for Combating Illegal Migration (DCIM) of the Ministry of the Interior justified the sales arguing that ""the Quran explicitly grants Muslims the right to kill or enslave any non-Muslims who fall into our hands. This was Muhammed's practice. It is our practice. No unbelievers have the right to criticize us for it.""

Anti-Abortion Midwife Loses Case

A Swedish court ruled that the government's refusal to permit Ellinor Grimmark to practice her trade as a midwife ""did not violate her freedom of opinion and expression.""

Judge Bebi Mordare ruled that government authorities were ""within their rights to reject Ms. Grimmark's privilege of conducting her trade in defiance of regulatory standards. Blocking her from her employment does not infringe on her freedom to hold or express her opinions about abortion.""

""The regulators have established professional standards that require all midwives to perform abortions if that is what the patient wishes,"" Mordare observed. ""Ms. Grimmark's contention that she should be allowed to select the types of services she will provide is contrary to public policy. Further, her suggestion that patients wanting an abortion have many other midwives who do not have moral objections to the procedure from which to choose stems from an incorrect premise on who is empowered to make the choice. First and foremost, it is the government's prerogative to decide who will be granted the option to choose. In regard to abortions, that option has been granted to the patients. Medical personnel who balk at carrying out any patient's choice are behaving unprofessionally and may be barred from the profession.""

Ms. Grimmark's unsuccessful effort to regain the right to continue her work birthing babies has left her with $170,000 in legal bills. She has moved to Norway where regulations do not require midwives to perform or participate in carrying out abortions.

In related news, Planned Parenthood awarded Hillary Clinton with a ""Champion of the Century"" award for ""her 40 years of advocacy for women who wish to be relieved of unwanted motherhood stemming from unprotected sex. Few have played as important a role in this great cause.""

Editor Says Sweden's Economy Needs More Immigrants

Åsa Linderborg, the editor of Sweden's Aftonbladet newspaper, contends that ""Sweden's economy would collapse without illegal immigrants. The influx of large contingents of these people creates extra demand for housing and welfare. This helps support the building trades and social workers, not to mention stimulating Swedes to work longer hours to pay the taxes needed to fund these benefits. Even the violence springing from these unassimilated new residents provides jobs for police, firemen, hospitals, morticians, and insurance adjusters.""

The fact that few of these new immigrants have jobs—only 500 of 2015's 160,000 immigrants are employed—was dismissed by Linderborg as irrelevant. ""Granted, these people aren't contributing much to the supply side, but their robust demand injects a vital stimulus. In a complex economy can we really afford to reject a specialized role for different segments of the population?""

Biased Media Tougher on Democrats, Clinton Operative Says

This week, former Hillary Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmeri agreed that media bias exists, but maintained that ""this makes it tougher on Democrats.""

""Look, when CNN or the New York Times portray Republicans as the scum they are the bar is set comfortably low,"" She argued. ""All any Republican has to do to rise above the bar is: nothing. The mere absence of the usual crime, corruption and depravity puts them in a more positive light than they really deserve.""

""The bar is set much higher for Democrats,"" Palmeri said. ""We are expected to deliver all-star caliber performances on a daily basis. When despite our best efforts we humanly fall short from time to time the media are forced to acknowledge our failure to live up to the standards everyone expects of us. Take last year's presidential election. As Trump reeled from scandal to gaffe to racism and verbal abuse he got a pass because no one really expected anything better. In contrast, the slightest misstep from Hillary was easily blown out of proportion. Whether it was the email snafu, the ""deplorables"" slip of the tongue, or her occasional fatigue—she was relentlessly exposed to unwarranted scrutiny.""

Palmeri expressed pessimism that this imbalance would ever be overcome. ""It's so unfair,"" she complained. ""I'm afraid that the recent effort to make CNN and the Times the arbiters of what's true and what's fake will be too little, too late. The best we can hope for is that the next Democratic Administration will be less tolerant and less merciful than President Obama was. Once all the GOP offenders are taken out the media's unfair treatment of Democrats can be better regulated via some sort of pre-publication screening and approval procedure.""

In related news, prominent Democrats denounced Rep Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) for her skepticism regarding the gas attack attributed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Former presidential candidate and Vermont Governor Howard Dean called her ""a disgrace"" who ""should not be in Congress."" Neera Tanden, close ally of Hillary Clinton, chastised voters ""for electing a person with such poor judgment."" Republican skeptics Sen. Rand Paul (Ky) and Rep, Thomas Massie (Ky) were not similarly denounced by GOP colleagues, a fact that Dean asserted ""reveals the intolerable tolerance that demonstrates their Party's unfitness to govern.""

Investigation of IRS Targeting Called ""Risky""

Lois Lerner, the IRS official implicated in the agency's illegal targeting of conservative groups for discriminatory treatment, came out strongly against the suggestion by House Republicans Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill) and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) that the Department of Justice look into the matter.

""The reopening of an incident occurring five years ago will only stir up unnecessary interest in something that cannot be undone,"" Lerner pleaded. ""The animosity that will be unfairly directed at me for misdeeds perpetrated by subordinates without my knowledge is risky. It would expose me to harassment and possible harm without really righting any of the wrongs that were done.""

Lerner also pointed out that ""the Department of Justice already considered the matter and absolved me of any culpability. For the case to be reopened now would constitute double jeopardy—something clearly prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.""

""If we were to accept Ms. Lerner's reasoning it would put most serious crimes out of the reach of justice,"" Roskam wryly observed. ""What is more irremediable than a murder? Should we let the perpetrator off the hook because his crime is 'something that cannot be undone?' The abuse of power carried out during Ms. Lerner's tenure at the IRS is something we cannot abide. An investigation and the application of appropriate remedies is essential if we hope to curb future abuses of a like nature.""

Bad Publicity Sparks Change in Policy at UA

The chaotic and violent ouster of Dr. David Dao from a United Airlines' flight so an airline employee could fly in his stead has netted the company a heap of undesirable publicity. This has sparked a change in policy.

Company spokeswoman Madeleine Flake admitted that ""the flaw in our procedures seemed to be the involuntary aspect of Dr. Dao's removal from the aircraft. If we could ensure voluntary exit similar scenes should be avoided in the future.""

It appears that the voluntary exit of unwanted passengers will be achieved by giving flight crews the option of releasing poisonous insects from overhead bins. Flake said ""the company's expectation is that once passengers are aware that noncompliance might expose them to this risk they will more readily give up their seats. A test run of the new policy was conducted on a recent flight from Houston, Texas to Calgary in Canada and we were very pleased with the results.""

What routes are left to fix the broken US government?,"Congress is corrupt. To fix congress, we have to bypass congress. Voting doesn't really work in a 2-party system where both parties are owned. And it seems protests are ineffective unless they are absolutely massive. What else can be done, without turning to violence?

One anti-corruption organization, represent.us, suggests the solution is to focus on sorting out local and state governments, and then the effects will ripple upwards. They actually created legislation and passed it in the state of South Dakota by popular vote. Then immediately it was found unconstitutional and was repealed through ""emergency measures"". Which sounds like corruption on first glance, but the bill was actually created by Soros and Rockefeller organizations, as the donor page shows: https://represent.us/donor-list/ The bill would've maintained the existing government, changing nothing, and then put on top of it another layer (the ""ethics committee"") that can fire anyone, and is appointed by the governor.  

So while the anti-corruption bill by represent.us _seems_ good on the face of it, the reality of the bill is that it was a power grab under the auspices of being an anti-corruption bill for the public good. The bill was opposed by the Koch Brothers. This means we have the leftist billionaires vs the rightist billionaires, both pretending to act in the benefit of the people, both vying for power over state and local governments. 

A second example: WolfPAC, started in 2011. It proposes to solve the problem with a constitutional amendment that is passed via state resolutions, rather than by congress. There are two ways to make a new constitutional amendment: 2/3 of each house of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, which is how it's usually done, or 2/3 of the states (34 states) can independently pass a resolution calling for a national convention to add an amendment. Then, ratification requires 3/4 of the states (38 states) to vote in support of an amendment before it becomes part of the Constitution. No congressional approval needed. The president can't veto it. This is true direct democracy. 

Vetting is needed to know if the WolfPAC resolution is genuinely anti-corruption or if it's pushed by billionaires looking to use it as a power grab, as is the case with represent.us. However they have managed to pass their resolution in 5 states already. 

America is heavily divided about a wide number of things, so proposing something that has broad support is difficult. It would have to be worded in a way that 3/4 of Americans approve of it, even in the face of twisted propaganda against it that would inevitably arise from the mainstream media to defend the establishment. So it would have to be very simple, without a lot of extras or baggage, and very direct. Then it has to be promoted. The media presence would be the trickiest part, most likely, because we wouldn't have billionaire help and the mainstream media would likely be working against us. 

If a good simple bill could be written, proper buzz could be generated about it, and some state votes were called, with enough attempts it could be passed in enough states to eventually amend the constitution. Or, get the laws changed on the state level so the effects ripple upward. Both approaches can be used in tandem, the state bill can be a slightly modified version of the state resolution. 

If you believe in the possibility of this approach, please spread the word.

Example of a Potential State Resolution &amp; Constitutional Amendment: 

* Change our voting system to a true multiparty system. End First-Past-The-Post.

* Undo and disallow all gerrymandering.

* No more revolving door between industry/lobbying and regulatory positions. At least a minimum of 7 years wait before going from one side to the other.

When did we forget about States' Rights?,"I remember that, back in either the 1920s or 1930s, a Supreme Court justice delivered an important opinion stating that each state basically had the right to experiment, as if we were running 50 (well 50 now, not back then, but still) different experiments in economics, healthcare, whatever across every state. 

Where did that idea go, and why is States' Rights such a loaded and forgotten thing?

I feel like whatever party is in power seems to just trample on the idea, and things like Obamacare take something which had been such a great state experiment like healthcare (think Massachusetts and other states) and then basically destroy it, overruling everything being tried and tested with some half-baked piece of trash legislation.

Shouldn't everyone be for states' rights? Leftists should want to try their crazy economic ideas in their states. Let California or Massachusetts or Washington raise their minimum wages to $500/hour and let them suffer the consequences; we'll all learn from it. Let some state do state-run healthcare, or another state have state-run liquor stores or whatever! If that's what the people in the state want, let them do it.

Then let Alabama get rid of the minimum wage, let Texas lower its taxes, let them do what they want. If people dislike it, states don't have hard borders. They can move. What's so wrong with that? 

Having things as centralized as they are now destroys states' individual identities and waters everything down. We're starting to lose the purpose of states. This is why I don't like the 17th amendment, incidentally, because the Senate is entirely pointless. It's meant to be the arm of the states' governments, and with the 17th, the states lost significant representation in the federal government.

Over time, we've become more and more centralized, less and less federal. We've strayed far from the vision of a nation of 50 United States, who can all try their crazy ideas in their little boxes.

Escaping the filter bubble,"Hi everyone,

I'm a Democrat and I get the vast majority of news from progressive sources. With all the talk in the media about polarization and 'filter bubbles' where people don't get exposed to the opposite ideological view, I've decided that I want to have a more balanced media diet. I have started watching more Fox News and PragerU videos on youtube. 

Many of these ideas seem strange to me. Here are a few things where my opinion has shifted:

1. Gun control. While I still believe that from a policy point of view it is undesirable to have people carry guns, I think society should be able to choose how much risk it is willing to put up with to allow people to do what they want. Banning everything that people enjoy may make the world safer, but I'm not sure we want to live in that kind of world.

2. Foreign policy. I think that having a strong military and having that military be guided by American ideals has worked well in the past. I know there is some disagreement about this within the Republican party at the moment, but I'm very sympathetic to the traditional foreign policy hawk argument.

Here are some issues where I don't completely understand or agree with the thinking:

1. Progressive taxes/minimum wage. Our society is at a point of technological advancement where a relatively small amount of well-educated people are disproportionately productive, while others are increasingly falling behind. I've looked at the data for this and the only way out of it I would see is some kind of redistribution. I myself a long time ago worked in a warehouse (as a freshman student) where I earned $9/h. Now I'm about to graduate with a top university degree and I'm getting $50k/yr grad-scheme offers. Per capita GNI in the US is $53,000+. I don't see why so many people have to struggle around the poverty line when it wouldn't really change the standards of living for people like me to pay more.

UBI which seems to be a bipartisan idea could be another way out of this, but I think people need a purpose in life and pride in the work they do so just giving people blind handouts is a bad idea.

2. Healthcare. Why the opposition to a single payer healthcare system? It seems to work well everywhere else in the world. It cuts out a lot of middlemen and is way cheaper and more efficient in the long-term. It also generates some positive externalities towards making people more healthy, for example, if the government has to spend a lot of money on treating obesity-related problems, then cost-effective solutions may include trying to reduce sugar or saturated fat consumption.

Would any conservatives want to try to persuade me to change my mind on the last two? I would love to hear some good arguments for both of them. Depending on the responses I get, I might post some more things that I can't get my head around.

Even when we get a bit punchy we mostly keep discussing the ideas and don't decay into name calling to win the argument. A bit of energetic insult slinging is no biggie, as long as the rest of the post is dedicated to backing up the attack with logic.

How do Conservatives think that government should deal with major non-military societal issues?,"I come in peace. Not looking for a debate, just an education on a point of view. Wanted to ask this question after I read about Bannon's mission to dissemble the administrative state.

I think one of the areas of disconnect between liberals and conservatives is the role of government in dealing with non-military macro issues like justice, education, health, environment, ethics, etc. 

As I understand it, the purposes of the agencies of an administrative state are to address these major issues. 

A liberal might posit that since those agencies report to an elected president, they are kept in check by democracy and thus incentivized to serve their society well; whereas an unregulated private sector is not necessarily incentivized to serve their society well. 

What level of law or regulation do Conservatives think appropriate? How do you incentivize the private sector to act in a manner that positively impacts the world we all live in? How important is it to positively impact the world?

Sidebar Honor: Andrew Breitbart,"March 1st will be the 5th anniversary of his death and we would like to honor a man who has had a positive impact on the conservative movement in modern times. While he himself was not 100% a conservative ideologue, he understood that the left and its tactics needed to be opposed. 

He helped to find young energetic conservatives/libertarians like Ben Shapiro and Greg Gutfeld and put them on the path towards driving a new wave of young conservatives in this country. He helped launch the original O'Keef investigative journalism that liberals have vilified that now goes by the name Project Veritas.

But most important he did the important job of networking these talented individuals to ensure that they had the resources to succeed and moral support to continue forward with the fight in the Culture War. A war that conservatives for the most part had abandoned in modern times to the detriment of the political landscape.

He died before his time and was a beacon of hope for the conservative movement. His torch has been passed on; but his contributions will be remembered. Let us hope that his movement continues and that conservatives in all areas will be not be harassed and ridiculed into silence. Not only do we have the facts on our side; but we also have the moral authority and we should never forget it.

George Will's Prediction,"It seems Geo. Will has decided that the conservatives will turn on Trump within the year.

http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/02/21/george-will-conservatives-will-turn-trump-mid-summer/

Note this terrific article about the President addressing CPAC, today.

http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/24/donald-trump-thrills-conservatives-cpac/

This is called massive cognitive dissonace between what Will stated and what has occurred at CPAC conference.

Geo. Will is a wishful thinker. Just like the Swedish PM, who sharply criticized Trump  on the riots and disorders occurring in Sweden caused by large numbers of Muslim immigrants.

And that evening, Stockholm in Rinksby had some of the worst rioting and damage in a very long time, by same Muslims. 

The NYT ""also ran"" an article against Trump's criticism of the Muslim problems in Sweden. And that same evening, the riots showed up, egregiously, the fake news in the NYT view of events. Yet again.

The Swedish PM and Will &amp; NYT have a lot in common. Their disregard for events in existence as they discounted important truths. And they will all pay a large price for colliding with reality so blatantly.

What's the difference between conservatism and the Alt-Right (from the liberal/progressive viewpoint)?,"I was just on the sub /r/fuckthealtright.  It spews a level of hate on par with white supremacy.  They're like the Westboro Baptist Church of liberals from what I'm seeing.  They have around 14k subscribers (right now).

My question is this, in looking over the posts there, where do most progressives draw the proverbial line from what is a (say) '*mainstream conservative*' to where they label you with their version of the n-word ""**altrightist**""?

Is gay tolerance that is their burning bush?  The mods seemingly self-identify as all being gay: which I have no problem with.  

Is it support of President Trump?  Is their argument that if you support Trump - you're alt-right?  Because by my estimation, and that of most traditional conservatives, Trump is a centrist (social liberal - married twice - son-in-law is a Jew - daughter converted).

What value is it that a Conservative supports that goes over their line?  Or have they simply labeled *everyone* on the right, the alt-right?  It would seem to me, the same way they've basically labeled *all* white people racist, all gun owners lunatics, all Christians zealots and all men sexist pigs they've simply decided we're **all** horrible people.  SMH.  

They're the extremists.  Just look at the posts.  It is easy for either side to grab headlines of the worst from our ideologies and paint everyone with that brush.  So if we (as conservatives) have to take ownership of idiots who shoot people in the name of racism, then wouldn't by similar logic, the liberals have to own all their criminals too?  Then, wouldn't their ranks be littered with a much greater number of killers, thieves and people who hate tribally?

"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: February 26, 2017 Edition","Montana Governor Blocks Right to Bear Arms

Montana Governor Steve Bullock (D) vetoed legislation that would have made the state a ""Constitutional carry"" state. That is, individuals would be permitted to exercise their right to bear arms as defined in the US Constitution's Second Amendment without having to obtain state or local government permission to do so.

In his veto message, Bullock declared that ""the idea that an individual is qualified to determine whether he needs to carry a firearm is absurd. Selfish concern for self-preservation at the expense of broader social goals must not derail sensible gun control. Right now, far too many people have guns. We ought to be culling the herd of individuals who the state decides do not need these weapons.""

""The police have enough weapons to protect the people who are essential members of society,"" the Governor asserted. ""If more private individuals start carrying it would dilute the government's ability to focus the use of deadly force in a more socially just and effective manner.""

""As for the tired argument that individuals might need these weapons to defend their lives and property, I say nonsense,"" Bullock said. ""First, no one has the right to shoot another person over a piece of property. Just because a person possesses that property doesn't refute someone else's claim to it. Those dispossessed by an unjust society may be more entitled to it than the person they are supposedly 'robbing.' If both parties are armed the violence would be escalated. Granted, it would be preferable for the dispossessed to wait for government to effect the transfer, but I blame archaic laws for their impatience.""

Trump Rescinds Obama Edict on Bathrooms

President Trump's Executive Order rescinding President Obama's Executive Order commanding federally funded institutions to permit individuals to use the bathrooms of the sex they imagine themselves to be sparked outrage from the gender-confused and their advocates.

Illinois Democratic gubernatorial aspirant J.B. Pritzker used Trump's action to solidify his credentials to the deranged base of the Party by advocating that ""everyone should use the other gender's bathroom as a protest against Trump's tyranny.""

Pritzker's ploy was criticized by Illinois State Rep. Will Guzzardi (D-Chicago) as ""missing the point of the Obama edict. Knowingly using the bathroom of the 'other gender' contradicts the intent of the directive. Urging a man who believes he is a woman to use the bathroom of the 'other gender' would guide him to the men's room. This exacerbates the biological injustice already inflicted on that person.""

Olympic champion transgender Caitlyn Jenner called Trump's move ""devastating. The option of entering restrooms or locker rooms of the gender to which a person may contemplate switching is an important way of gathering data that could help determine whether to make the switch or not. Finding out whether you would be comfortable within previously off-limits environments seems to me to be a necessary step in identifying one's own sexual orientation.""

CNN talking head Chris Cuomo characterized Trump's approach as ""a return to bigotry. The right would like to emphasize a 'worst case' scenario where perverts feign transgenderism in order to gawk at or molest young girls. These girls and their over-protective fathers need to get over their prejudices against showering with people they think are men just because they have a man's anatomy. Those trapped in the wrong body are the most oppressed members of society. The government needs to do everything it can to lift them out of their misery. By negating President Obama's grant of protective status for them Trump is on the wrong side of history.""

Presidential Press Secretary Sean Spicer ridiculed the hyperventilation over the issue saying that ""all the President did was rescind his predecessor's illegal imposition of a rule for which there is no legal authority. The US Constitution does not grant the federal government the power to decree who may use which bathroom. The 9th and 10th Amendments clearly reserve this power to the people and the states. We are merely removing a turd left behind by a usurpation that ought never to have occurred.""

Mexico Has Plan to Counter Trump's Wall

Angry that US President Trump has deviated from twenty years of ""benign neglect"" in response to illegal immigration, the Mexican government bragged that it has ""an inexpensive countermeasure that will completely neutralize Mr. Trump's highly touted wall.""

Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray maintained that ""simple economics will defeat all of his attempts to stop our people from reclaiming what is rightfully ours. There is no way Mr. Trump can neutralize the prosperity in America that gives virtually every Mexican the incentive to go to America. As long as my country can continue policies that assure the wealth gap will remain, the flow northward will be unending.""

""On a tactical level, a wall is an insufficient barrier,"" Videgaray continued. ""We will build ladders and catapults to carry people and drugs over it. These will cost us little compared to what the Americans will pay to build the thing. The billions they spend will be in vain.""

Sweden in Throes of Islamic Crime Wave

Sweden has long been admired by the left as a model society. This Scandinavian ""Eden"" has avoided getting embroiled in foreign wars. They were even able to get along with the Nazis when so many other countries couldn't. Their socially tolerant attitudes led them to admit hundreds of thousands of Muslim immigrants.

This past week, US President Donald Trump referenced ""what's going on in Sweden"" in support of his efforts to exercise greater scrutiny over who is allowed into America. The media characterized Trump's statement as ""false"" or ""delusional"" since there have been no large scale jihadi terrorist attacks in Sweden.

However, large scale attacks aren't the only dangerous consequence of Sweden's generosity toward Muslim immigrants. Since allowing hundreds of thousands of them into the country crime rates have soared, the streets have become unsafe, and frequent disorder has become a mounting problem.

Per Jimmie Akesson and Mattias Karlsson, leaders of the Swedish Democrats Party, sided with Trump. ""The situation is worse than he portrayed in his speech,"" Karlsson contended. ""Police officers, firefighters and ambulance personnel are regularly attacked. Anti-Semitism has risen. Jews in are threatened, harassed and assaulted in the streets. Cars left unguarded are routinely set on fire. Muslim men comprise 2% of the population in Sweden, but commit 77% of the rapes. The government officials who brought this on with their careless immigration policies are in a state of denial about the Hell they've unleashed on our citizens.""

Sweden's justice and migration minister Morgan Johansson denounced Akesson and Karlsson for spreading what he insisted was ""an inaccurate and unflattering picture of our country. The damage done to tourism from these unwanted reports of immigrant unrest goes far beyond the damage done by the Muslim rioters and criminals. Millions, perhaps billions, in revenues are at stake if this view is allowed to influence people's decision to visit Sweden. I can think of no punishment too severe for what these two have done.""

Of course, Sweden isn't the only European country to have suffered from excessive Muslim immigration. Germany's domestic security and intelligence agency reports that the number of radical Islamists in the country has risen by over 1500% since 2013. In Denmark, a Dane is going on trial for blasphemy because he burned a Koran. The Danish government defended the action as ""essential if we hope to head off the kind of rioting that occurred after a Danish newspaper published cartoons lampooning Muhammad in 2005. It is better that one man be publicly punished for this offense than that thousands suffer another outbreak of religious violence.""

California Senator Silenced for Disrespecting Tom Hayden

After the California legislature memorialized former State Senator Tom Hayden, who died last October, Sen. Janet Nguyen (R-Garden Grove) attempted to offer another perspective on the former 1960s radical anti-war agitator. Presiding Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) ordered her to shut up and when she wouldn't, had her physically removed from the senate chamber.

""I realize that many of the senators who honored the late Sen. Hayden may have been ignorant of his role in prolonging the Vietnam War and enabling the Communists to kill millions of my former countrymen,"" Nguyen said. ""Rather than let his misdeeds go down the memory hole I wanted a few minutes to offer a balanced account of the role he played.""

Lara dismissed GOP contentions that not allowing Nguyen's remarks constituted unwarranted censorship. ""Words must be worthy of being heard before they can be permitted to be spoken,"" he argued. ""To many in the Democratic Party Hayden was a hero. Nothing Sen. Nguyen could say would change that. Clearly, granting her leave to speak would've been a waste of our time no matter how brief her remarks may have been.""

In other California news, facing a $2 billion budget deficit, Governor Jerry Brown (D) urged lawmakers to cut $115 million from the Middle Class Scholarship Program so that funding for the California Dream Act could be spared. The California Dream Act provides scholarships for students in the country illegally. ""It is a question of priorities and consequences,"" Brown declared. ""These middle class kids already are well enough off. They don't need the help as much as the 'dreamers' do. Getting a free education is one of the key reasons why immigrants come to America. If we don't provide for them their incentive to come here will be diminished. The middle class kids will be here regardless of whether they get aid.""

Feds Pooh-Pooh Concerns About Faked Studies

The National Science Foundation (NSF) Inspector General has found 74 instances where researchers funded by the NSF engaged in plagiarism, falsifying data, stealing, wasting government money, or committing other fraud.

NSF spokesman Bobbie Mixon brushed aside concerns, saying ""they are of little consequence. No one reads the reports that we publish. Why should it make any difference whether the results are fake? We are providing an income for members of the academic community. The arcane and basically unreadable documents they produce are a byproduct of that greater objective. Considering the massive amount of money being squandered across a plethora of federal agencies it would be unfair to single out this one enclave of waste, fraud and abuse. After all, do we really want a cadre of unemployed university professors roaming the streets looking for trouble?""

"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: January 8, 2017 Edition","Man Tortured in Anti-Trump Protest

An 18-year-old mentally challenged man was tortured for two days by Black Lives Matter-inspired criminals as ""a protest against the racist Trump Administration."" Four Chicago millenials—Jordan Hill, 18, Tesfaye Cooper, 18, Brittany Covington, 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24 beat, kicked, burned, and cut their victim while shouting ""f*** Trump"" and ""f*** white people.""

Members of the leftist media at CNN and NBC were hesitant to judge the perpetrators too harshly. NBC News correspondent Ron Mott said ""this incident strikes me as an example of youthful stupidity rather than a crime, per se. They posted a video of their interactions with this individual they took into their home. If their intent had been criminal why would they broadcast their escapade?""

CNN political commentator Symone Sanders, a former adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, blamed the assailants actions on ""Trump stirring up hostility in people across the country with his hate-filled rhetoric. It is Trump who has threatened to cut off people's welfare and force them to get jobs. That they would strike out in fear and anger is understandable.""

Sanders also dismissed racism as a motive. ""First, all the people charged with this man's mistreatment are black,"" she pointed out. ""There is considerable scholarly debate as to whether it is possible for a black person to be racist. Second, as I understand it, the victim was chosen because of his mental disability, not his skin color."" Sanders said that the fact that the perps appeared on their own video shouting ""f*** white people"" was ""not relevant,"" since ""this is a sentiment shared by all the black people I know. It's just the way we talk among ourselves.""

CNN host Don Lemon rebuffed his interviewee Matt Lewis' contention that ""it's evil. It's brutality. It's man's inhumanity to man"" and blamed the kidnapping and torture on ""the poor parenting of these misguided young people. I don't think it's evil. 'Evil' is Trump becoming this nation's president in two weeks.""

CNN reporter Sara Ganim couldn't stop herself from laughing at the Facebook video of the victim's torments. ""My favorite part was where they made him drink out of the toilet,"" she recounted. ""The retard deserved it. He voted for Trump.""

White House press secretary Josh Earnest observed that ""the beating demonstrates a level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans. On the other hand, there are also a lot of Americans who would hold that the injuries inflicted on this one white man are insufficient payback for 300 years of slavery and Jim Crow laws.""

In related news, President Barack Obama told ABC News correspondent Judy Hsu that ""race relations, like everything else, have gotten better during my term in the White House."" As proof of his claim, the President cited his recent award of the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service. ""No other president has received as many awards as I have,"" Obama bragged. ""This is why I'm confident that the verdict of history will rank my presidency as one of the best, if not the best, this nation has ever seen.""

Kerry Mocks Peace-Mongers Abroad and at Home

US Secretary of State John Kerry blamed former United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron and British members of parliament for thwarting President Obama's plan to intervene in the Syrian civil war and confront the Russians.

""When the President of the United States has decided for war you'd think our so-called allies would stand with us,"" Kerry asserted. ""However, a gutless Prime Minister Cameron insisted on getting his parliament's approval before joining us in an attack. Well, parliament wouldn't go along. President Obama was so miffed at this betrayal that he called the whole thing off. In hindsight, he probably should have gone ahead. If the country had been at war with the Russians in 2016 President Obama, like FDR, would likely have won a third term.""

Kerry contrasted the Syrian War fizzle with ""the smashing success of our overthrow of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The sodomization and murder of this long-time oppressor of the Libyan people sent a strong message to other would-be tyrants around the world that being deposed in the era of Obama would not result in exile abroad to live in luxury, nor even a simple execution like that dished out to Romania's Nicolae Ceau?escu, but complete humiliation and torture followed by an ignominious death.""

The Secretary of State said he doubted that ""a President Trump would have the courage to impose his will on this country's enemies like President Obama has. Trump has already taken war with Russia off the table. What kind of leverage will he have after publicly expressing his aversion to such a confrontation? Trump's notion that the United States might make common cause with Russia against the Islamic State is laughable. As President Obama has warned, the future will not belong to the enemies of Islam. Trump is betting on the wrong horse.""

In related news, according to a Congressional Research Service report, Obama sold more weapons than any other American president since World War II. Islamic monarchy and exporter of jihadi terrorists around the globe, Saudi Arabia has been the Obama Administration's favorite customer. Overall sales to the Saudis approved by Obama's State Department, pending delivery of equipment and specialized training for troops are expected to amount to $115 billion.

Senate Rejects Dem Proposal to Require 60 Votes to Repeal Obamacare

A move by Democrats to reestablish a rule that would require a minimum of 60 votes for any legislation to pass the Senate was repulsed by a 52-48 straight party line vote.

Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, recent vice-presidential running mate of Hillary Clinton, sponsored the 60 vote requirement and called the GOP's stance against it ""unfair. For decades it had been the tradition in the Senate to permit the minority party to block legislation that couldn't obtain a super majority. Now just because former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) eliminated this tradition when Democrats held the majority in the Senate the GOP feels it is their right to do as he did. Well, two wrongs don't make a right. It's shameful that the Republicans would act as if they do.""

The urgency of Kaine and the rest of the Democrats stems from the intent of the Republican leadership to use Reid's trick to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) via the reconciliation process where a simple majority is all that is needed to enact legislation.

Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo) spoke against Kaine's measure and characterized the use of Reid's trick to repeal the ACA ""poetic justice. This horrendous government-mandated health insurance scheme was passed without a singe Republican vote for it. It was passed without a proper evaluation of its content at the behest of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) who flippantly argued that we had to pass the bill in order to find out what was in it. As it turned out, in direct contradiction to President Obama's solemn promises, it did not guarantee that people could keep doctors and plans that they liked. It did not lead to lower costs for consumers. It did force millions to purchase plans that featured outrageously high premiums and deductibles. For millions the effect was paying more to get less. That Reid's trick enables us to repeal this monstrosity is karma.""

Repeal of Obamacare is projected to cost hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats their jobs. ""All the complicated paperwork required by the ACA creates jobs for a huge segment of government and insurance company administrative personnel,"" Kaine pointed out. ""Those who call this 'useless' or 'unnecessary' are overlooking the human factor. The idea that these people can be shifted into manufacturing or some other sector that produces products that consumers would willingly buy is, in my opinion, too risky.""

Senator Has Concerns About Education Nominee

Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee expressed doubts about the fitness of President-Elect Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.

""I appreciate that Ms. DeVos took the time to meet with me, I can't say that I would have done the same had our roles been reversed,"" Murray declared. ""At our meeting she did nothing to allay my fears that she would continue to be an advocate for school choice. This pernicious ideology is founded on the absurd premise that individual parents ought to have the biggest say in their children's education. This is against everything I and the Democratic Party have been fighting for over many years.""

""Education is far too important to be left in the hands of non-experts,"" the Senator contended. ""For one thing, choice will negate efforts to ensure uniformity. Independently run schools will choose diverse curricula. Parents who choose wisely will give their children an unfair advantage over parents who aren't as astute in selecting where to send them to be schooled. Those less informed will likely default to just sending their children to the nearest public school. If no one is allowed to choose we will have a better chance at equalizing the opportunities for all.""

""An added concern of mine is that the whole thrust of the drive for school choice is anti-social at its core,"" Murray continued. ""Many of those who opt for non-public schools harbor deviant political ideas. Letting these parents remove their children from the social mix of the public school student body endangers these children's future compatibility with their age cohort peers. Alienation is the inevitable outcome for children deprived of the reaffirming social network provided by a common educational experience. Saving these children from such a fate is the duty of those of us elected to protect the most vulnerable members of our society.""

Senator Warns Trump

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) warned President-Elect Donald Trump that ""he's entering dangerous waters when he criticizes our intelligence community. Has he forgotten that the CIA has toppled dozens of governments around the world? Has he forgotten what they did to President Kennedy after he vowed to break up the Agency following the Bay of Pigs fiasco?""

""I have my differences with Donald, but I wouldn't want to see him get his head blown off,"" Schumer said. ""He needs to accept that there are limits to what he can do when he deals with these trained assassins.""

Assange Mocks Podesta

The Wikileaks publication of a raft of embarrassing emails hacked from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta may have undermined Hillary's chances to be elected president. For his part, Podesta has complained loudly about presumed Russian involvement, claiming that ""intelligence sources say only the Russians have the kind of sophisticated techniques required.""

Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, refuted Podesta's claim saying that ""a fourteen-year-old could've hacked Podesta's email account. His password was 'password.' His email could hardly have been less secure.""

Podesta labeled Assange's assertion ""grossly misleading. My password wasn't 'password.' It was 'passw0rd' with a zero. The chance that some non-state actor could've broken that code has to be extremely slim, maybe impossible.""

I'm a little skeptical about that mainly for blue-collar workers or lower class workers. Automation seems like it's progressing; and fast. I think to many people they don't consider it a legitimate threat because they aren't too well-informed on it. According to the Pew Research Center 80% of people think their jobs will still exist in the next 50 years. That's extremely naive and laughable. 

For example, truckers are a very important and common blue collar job. [There are already self driving on the roads](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/). This means the future of truckers isn't looking too bright.

- Democrats must defend **25** Senate seats. (Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania included)
- 5 of those seats are in states that Trump *dominated*. (Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri, Montana, &amp; West Virginia)
- Republicans must defend **8** Senate seats.

Republicans are expected to begin this coming year with a 52-48 lead in the Senate. There is a real opportunity to capture another 8+ seats in 2018 giving the GOP a super-majority in the Senate.

Looking Fascism up on Google gives misleading definition.," When you google fascism you are greeted with this definition:

&gt;an authoritarian and nationalistic **right-wing** system of government and social organization.

Now this definition seems to contradict itself.  I asked myself, ""How could Right-wing conservatives, be Authoritarian?  It goes against the very fabric of what it means to be ""conservative"".  The banner for this subreddit literally says ""Don't Tread on Me.""  

I wanted to get a better understanding of how that could possibly work.

If you go to the Library of Economics and Liberty website it says: 
&gt; As an economic system, fascism is socialism with a capitalist veneer.

It goes on to say:
&gt; Where socialism abolished money and prices, fascism controlled the monetary system and set all prices and wages politically.

Now this directly contradicts google's immediate definition because conservatism is literally the exact opposite of socialism. (or close)  Plus, being anti-entrepreneur is the complete opposite of what we believe.

So I wanted to see if other reliable sources contradicted google's go-to definition.


Merriam-Webster's definition is
&gt; a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition

Pulling Good Republicans from Senate Seats or Governorships is a Mistake,"We've all heard the rumors about Ted Cruz going to AG or the SCOTUS.  Now there's talk of Nikki Haley going to Secretary of State, and a few other rumors about sitting Republicans being moved to Cabinet positions.

In my opinion, this would be a mistake.  Our majority in the Senate is quite thin, so we really can't afford to put any seats up for election.  Maybe if we come through 2018 with 55 to 60 Republicans in the Senate we could appoint one or two of those to the Cabinet, but we need to keep our majority there.

Same goes for governorships.  If a Convention of States is going to happen soon, we'll need the governors there to shepherd that process and make sure the Democrats have as few opportunities to block it as possible.

Madison’s fear – which Alexis de Tocqueville later dubbed “the tyranny of the majority” – was that a faction could grow to encompass more than 50 percent of the population, at which point it could “sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens.” Madison has a solution for tyranny of the majority: “A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking.” Anyways let me know what you think about it and if you feel as a nation we should keep the system or not!

Question: Why doesn't the logic used to defend the Electoral College not apply to Presidential appointments?,"Edit: Double negative in the title is a typo, read what's below for an explanation of the question. 

Proponents of the Electoral College (EC) often point to the defense of minorities from the tyranny of the majority as a major positive outcome of using an EC to select the POTUS. In order to become President, a person needs to appeal to voters across many different types of states, economic backgrounds, and cultural identities. The EC stops a candidate from focusing on the popular vote (i.e. only worrying about LA, Chicago, and NYC) in order to be elected. It gives a strong voice to those people who are not represented in large cities, and, as I said, inhibits majority rule over a minority of people. 

Why does this not apply to Presidential appointments? Let me be clear; I understand the 60:40 vote for appointments was undone by Harry Reid and the democratic congress under Obama. But now that the tables have turned, and the nuclear option is in the hands of the GOP held congress, I've seen many people talk about how happy they are that all of Trump's appointments are going to go through (assuming none of the Republican senators go against party lines). Effectively enforcing majority rule over the minority party. This matter is compounded in that Harry Reid never had both House and Senate, as is the case for congress right now. 

So, to get to the point. Why is the defense of the minority from majority tyranny a valid line of reasoning to defend the EC, but is not used to seek bipartisan support for Presidential appointments? Shouldn't the appointments be people that are able to appeal (at least partially) to both sides of the political spectrum.  ",Conservative,1479487927,kitzdeathrow,1,1,True,2016-11-18

In other words, Trump wasn't a plant - we can't blame the Democrats for our mistake (isn't that what Lefties do - blame others?)  The fault for Trump's nomination lies squarely on the shoulders of the GOP, both its voters and its milquetoast elected officials who created the environment of voter-dissatisfaction that led to Trump's preeminence.

"What is the true unemployment number in the US today when 151,240,000 have filed for unemployment benefits since President Obama took office?","I was surprised at the announcement that the unemployment number dropped from 5 percent to 4.9 percent in January 2016.  I guess they forgot that 1.4 million people had filed for first time unemployment benefits in January. Then, they did it again this week when they said the unemployment rate dropped to 4.7% for May.  This is after the government announced that only 38,000 jobs were created in May.  Again they forgot to mention that 1,107,000 people filed for first time unemployment benefits in May. Maybe this is the new math that is taught in schools today or maybe it is just PC gone to the extreme.
We get weakly unemployment numbers every Friday.  They now run some 200 to 300 thousand every week. We also get jobs created report of some 38 to 200 thousand jobs but they are every month so as to make the effect less devastating.  We have over 1 million jobs lost every month since President Obama has been in office.  
I totaled up the total number of first time unemployment applications since President Obama took office January 20, 2009. This is from the US Jobless Claims SA Charts INJCJC Bloomberg, ycharts.com/indicators/initial_claims_for_unemployment_insurance, and weekly numbers published recently. Since President Obama took office, the number new first time unemployment applications is 151,240,000.  That is some 151million Americans that have lost their jobs under this president.  The requirement for this information is from US Jobless Claims SA Charts in INJCJC Bloomberg as Rate Profile Information for INJCJC as follows:

“Weekly initial jobless claims is the actual number of people who have filed for unemployment benefits for the first time. Following five (5) eligibility criteria must be met in order to file for unemployment benefits: 1. Meet the requirements of time worked during a 1 year period (full time or not). 2. Become unemployed through no fault of your own (cannot be fired). 3. Must be able to work, no physical or mental holdbacks. 4. Must be available for work. And 5. Must be actively seeking work.”

Since President Obama has been in office, he claims he created 14 million jobs, however some 151million Americans have lost their jobs, this leaves 137 million Americans that have lost their jobs if we assume there are no duplicates in the process. This is hard to comprehend. In the last 99 weeks, some 28 million Americans have filed for first time unemployment benefits.  If a person cannot find a job, they can stay on unemployment for up to 99 weeks, just shy of two years.  Thus one can assume that there are 28 million people still unemployed since there is no reason to find work if the government will pay them for not working. I tried to find the number of employed Americans and from the US labor department home page the number is 142 million for the employed civilian work force.   I can assume that a person on unemployment benefits will say there as long as they can if no jobs are available. Thus if we divide 28 million by142 million, we get 20 percent unemployed.
Another way to look at these numbers is that since President Obama took office, 151 million Americans have lost their jobs.  If the American work force is 142 million according to the US labor department home page, about half of the working Americans have lost their job since he became President.  This gives an unemployment number of over 50 percent. One other explanation is that a number of people are claiming unemployment compensation that should not be. In either case, the unemployment data provided to the public is grossly distorted if not an outright lie.

"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: October 2, 2016 Edition","FBI's Latest Email Disclosure Has Surprising Content

Within the latest Friday evening document ""dump"" from the FBI was evidence that Hillary Clinton's lawyers deleted 1,000 emails between General David Patraeus. At the time Hillary was Secretary of State Petraeus led US Central Command and later became director of the CIA.

While it would appear that communications between the Secretary of State and Patraeus would be work-related, Hillary offered a different explanation. ""David is a very avid yoga enthusiast,"" she said. ""He and I were in regular communication comparing notes and engaging in some friendly competition to see who could complete the most exercises each week. So, it should be no mystery as to why my lawyers erased those emails.""

Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex) called Clinton's explanation ""as ludicrous a lie from a high ranking government official as one could imagine. The idea that these two were yoga workout buddies is laughable. It is obvious that this woman has no shame. It is also obvious that the FBI investigation of her emails was a charade. Clearly, Secretary Clinton lied under oath on several occasions. Clearly, there was a pattern of obstruction to the erasure of emails and disappearances of numerous mobile devices. Heck, there's even an email chain with the words 'Hilary coverup operation' in the 'subject' line in messages sent to and from Hillary Clinton. For FBI Director James Comey to assert that he found no evidence of intent to break the law defies logic and common sense.""

A possible rationale for Comey's willful blindness on the matter may have been the discovery of emails from President Obama among the recovered deleted messages. Interestingly, the President used a pseudonym to sign his emails. For the record, Obama has denied that he had any knowledge of Clinton's illegal email practices. Yet, amazingly, he was still able to communicate with her using this illegal arrangement.

Press Secretary Josh Earnest insisted that ""the presence of the President's emails in this system doesn't prove he consciously knew anything about it. He could have merely been replying to emails originated by Secretary Clinton. He could have used a fake name as a security precaution. In any case, all of this is moot because the investigation has been closed by the Department of Justice and all of the principal co-conspirators have been granted immunity. So, even if a 'smoking gun' were to be uncovered there'd be nothing anyone could do about it.""

In related news, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange released 1700 of Clinton's emails that he says ""show her role in the absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, which led to the occupation by ISIS of large segments of that country and facilitated weapons going over to ISIS affiliated jihadists in Syria. She was the instigator of an expanded conflict and must bear responsibility for the deaths of thousands of noncombatants at the hands of the bloodthirsty Islamists that were armed and emboldened by her actions.""

Clinton Sics Machado on Trump

At this week's presidential debate Hillary Clinton contended that rival Donald Trump had ""cruelly abused"" Alicia Machado, 1996's Miss Universe, alleging he called her ""Miss Piggy"" for getting fat during the year she held the title. According to Hillary ""this shows the kind of deplorable disrespect for women that proves him unfit to be president.""

For her part, Machado admits that she has no witnesses to back up her claims of ""mental abuse,"" but insists that ""Trump is a horrible person."" What recorded evidence there is suggests that contrary to abusing Ms, Machado, Trump actually tried to help her. When his CBS partners in the Miss Universe consortium wanted to replace Machado with the less rotund runner-up, Trump worked to give her a second chance. While acknowledging that stress can make a person overeat, like he himself has done from time to time, Trump recommended weight reduction training so she could fulfill her contractual obligations.

Since completing her term as Miss Universe Machado went on to engage in some dubious behaviors including threatening a Venezuelan judge in 1998 who was handling the case of her boyfriend who was charged with attempted murder. In 2005 Ms. Machado apparently had sex with host Fernando Acaso on an episode of the La Granja Spanish TV show. This escapade broke up her engagement with then Philadelphia Phillies baseball player Bobby Abreu.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook didn't dispute the checkered past of Ms. Machado, but questioned its relevance. ""The issue is Trump's treatment of women,"" Mook argued. ""Whether these women be of high or low caliber shouldn't matter. Voters need to focus on only one thing: do we want a man like Donald Trump as our next president? Or do we want a woman of dignity and distinction like Secretary Clinton? It's that simple.""

In related news, in an effort to deflect potential criticism of how she has treated women that ""became involved with her husband,"" Hillary told Washington Post reporter Shawn Boburg that ""both Bill and I felt for these unfortunate misguided souls. Sadly, there are many mentally unstable women who fantasize about receiving the attentions of a powerful man. We always tried to reach out to those who accused Bill of improprieties and reassure them that they were always in our thoughts, that we were willing to do whatever we could to help because, as you know, Bill is hypersensitive to the pain of others and would do whatever was necessary to try to end it.""

Passenger Bumped from Seat to Appease Muslims

Booking her flight in advance and paying for her ""guaranteed"" seat didn't ensure that Mary Campos would get what she ordered. As she arrived at the boarding gate she was bumped to a different seat to ""accommodate the cultural beliefs"" of two Muslim men.

United Airlines spokesperson Amir Fuol explained that ""we regret that Ms. Campos was unhappy with the handling of the seat assignments on her flight. United holds our employees to the highest standards of professionalism and has zero tolerance for discrimination.""

Campos complained that ""this blather from Mr. Fuol explains nothing. How do the beliefs of a pair of foreigners trump my right as an American to equal treatment?""

Fuol maintained that ""the switch was as much for Ms. Campos safety as it was a show of respect for different cultural practices. Would she really have preferred to be seated next to two men whose inexperience with scantily clad American women may have resulted in her being fondled or worse? She would be suing us for sure had we rashly seated her so close to these men.""

In related news, YouTube has blocked trailers for the faith-based movie I'm Not Ashamed on the grounds that ""its overt and unbalanced promotion of the Christian religion may be deemed offensive by persons of other faiths and as such it can be construed as 'hate speech.'""

Dead People Submit New Voter Registrations in Virginia

A number of new applications for voter registrations recently submitted in Harrisonburg, Virginia were discovered to carry the names of persons recently deceased. The ""anomaly"" came to light when an employee in the registrar's office noticed that one of the new registrations was for Richard Claybrook Sr., the late father of a well-known local judge. Ultimately, 19 of the applications submitted by Andrew Spieles, a member of the Young Democrats club at James Madison University, on behalf of the community activist group ""Harrisonburg VOTES"" were deemed suspicious.

Republicans are incensed. Virginia House Speaker William Howell (R-Stafford) asked ""how often do we hear our Democrat colleagues suggest that voter fraud doesn't exist or is a myth? Well, this is just one piece of evidence that continuing efforts to defraud the election process are real.""

Del. Marcus Simon (D-Fairfax) pooh-poohed GOP concerns and called the recent flap ""small potatoes"" and the perpetrator ""inept. Registering ineligible voters doesn't mean illegal votes will be cast in their names. Votes would still have to be cast either in person by elderly impostors or through absentee ballots. There are additional steps that would have to be taken before the scheme would be successful. Besides, 20 bogus votes aren't likely to sway an election. Republicans are getting all worked up over nothing.""

In related news, it was discovered that Arcan Cetin, a resident alien from Turkey who shot five people to death at a mall in Burlington, Washington, illegally voted in three elections since 2014. A study done by professors from Old Dominion University and George Mason University estimated that about 6% of non-citizens illegally cast ballots in the 2008 election. Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman told a Seattle TV station that ""the State is barred by the feds from verifying citizenship status. They claim that verification is a federal responsibility. Yet, the Obama Administration steadfastly refuses to share the data they have with the states. We are left with no choice except to take the applicants' word for whether they are citizens.""

Presidential Candidates Name Favorite World Leader

In a bid to probe one dimension of the presidential candidates' perspectives on world politics and foreign relations, the media asked each of them to name their favorite foreign leader.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tabbed Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel as her favorite. ""Chancellor Merkel has been an extraordinarily strong leader,"" Clinton asserted. ""She has opened the doors of her country to more than a million Muslims from the Middle East. She has bravely faced down opposition to her policies in the midst of the difficulties of acclimation for these refugees.""

Clinton went on to contrast ""Merkel's generosity with our own country's xenophobic hesitancy to welcome those fleeing from war and atrocities in their home countries. Sure, we've let a few thousand in, but if we were to be as openhearted as Germany we'd be allowing millions to find safety on our shores. When I'm president this will change.""

GOP presidential contender Donald Trump chose Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as his favorite foreign leader saying that ""here we have a person whose tiny country is surrounded by hostile nations who repeatedly vow to annihilate the Jews. Yet he has the courage and toughness to stand firm on behalf of his people. It's a model that I will strive to live up to if I become president of the United States.""

Libertarian candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson acknowledged what he termed ""an Aleppo moment"" and admitted that ""I have no favorites that I can think of, but the notion that we need to be so active around the world strikes me as the bigger problem. It wouldn't really matter who led other governments if the United States were to mind its own business. I'd like to see a more mellow and relaxed America.

Green Party candidate Jill Stein opted for Elizabeth May, Leader of the Green Party of Canada, saying that ""while she doesn't yet lead a nation she embodies values that I think are aimed at a better world—ending the rape of the planet by humans, abolishing industrial society, and equal sharing of income and wealth. The fact that she is a woman gives greater credence to her Party's message. Men have played too big a role in ruining the environment. It's time we gave women a chance.""

"When will this ""ISLAMOPHOBIA"" nonsense end?","Okay so i'm from Finland. This just hit the news : 

http://www.ksml.fi/kotimaa/Miehelle-vankeutta-raiskauksesta-Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4ss%C3%A4-%E2%80%93-seurasi-uhriaan/814805

It's in Finnish so most of you won't understand it so i'll just explain. Basically some guy named ""Mustafa Saad Mohammed Karaghool"" raped a woman in Jyväskylä, and also molested another woman. And guess the prison sentence he got. 2. F*cking. Years. And obviously this isn't the first time this happened, and the things happening in places like Germany are higher in volume but i just had to mention the ridiculous freedom these f*ckers (Excuse my language) are given to commit crime. 

I'm seriously so pissed right now. We actually have this sort of organization called ""The Soldiers of Odin"" in Finland. It's basically Finnish men who patrol the streets because the cops won't protect our people (especially the women). And OF COURSE they get called racists and islamophobic yada-yada-yada you know the drill.

Why is it bad that these people wan't to protect the people since the government won't do anything? Why is the government still licking muslim people's boots? What is SO SPECIAL about muslims that they don't have to abide by the law half the time, and when they get sentences it's so short that it's not even relevant? How can people still believe this ""Not all muslims"" nonsense? Obviously not all muslims are like that, but it's sad to say that the vast majority of muslims coming into Europe as migrants right now are horrible people. They are _NOT_ compatible with our culture, and they don't show any will to learn about our culture. All they want is social security and maybe some women to rape and they'll be happy. Westernized muslims are completely fine. I think everyone has the right to believe in whatever they want to, but these people coming from countries where homosexuality is illegal (sometimes punishable by death), where women get stoned for adultery and where women are treated like dogs are just not compatible with us.

Oh and have you also noticed that like 80% of the ""refugees"" are 20 year old men with iphones and leather jackets? Where are the elderly? Where are the children? Where are the women?

And also, why do people just throw the word ""racist"" around? 

Racism definition :

a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human racial groups determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to dominate others or that a particular racial group is inferior to the others.


How is the fact racist, that people don't like it that in their culture it's okay for the women to have to obey her husband, that it's okay to hit women, and it's okay to kill wrong believers? Why is this violent culture and political system being forced onto us, and the government won't do sh*t? I mean hell, muslim isn't even a race for god's sake.

Why is political correctness more important than the lives of our people? People are such p*ssies man, i swear...

"As a left-leaning moderate, what were the reasons republicans didn't get behind Kasich?","First of all, I would like to say I'm impressed by this community. Most of you are extremely fair in your criticisms of all candidates and actually form well-made arguments of issues i disagree with. I find this to be the most reasonable political sub next to r/nuetralpolitics. I was a bernie supporter for a while until many conversations with my Dad educated me on some of the dangers of his policies. (hes a nevertrump conservative and I respect his opinions probably more than anyone else, basically he's just smarter than me haha)
After lurking here for a while I can see many of you share my overall positive opinion of Kasich and Rubio (don't really like Cruz at all to be honest, sorry for those who love him here). All I can think right now is how easily Kasich could have won this election. So many liberals and independents were craving for a reasonable conservative to vote for and are strictly voting Hilary because it isn't Trump. After reviewing Kasich's policies I think he would have won comfortably and been a great president. So from a conservative standpoint, what got in the way of most conservatives rallying behind him?

We Need Common Ground Between Trump Supporters and Bernie Bros,"I see some anti-BLM posts in this sub, how is that really productive? It's not.  It's just some nonsense about ""feels"" that divides people.

I think that there are certain areas where Trump supporters and Bernie bros are similar to each other and maybe we should clarify these things.  It mostly comes down to globalism, which is significant.

The previous generation grew up in what may have been the easiest time ever to be a human being.  Aside from the Vietnam war, everything was simple: jobs for everyone, people having as many (or as few) kids as they wanted, people getting married or free loving/swinging as they wished because they had jobs.  Morality was simple, you had the Soviet Union (bad for most people) and the west (good for most people).

Today everything is complicated and few people get to do what they want.  Our leaders' best guess is to try and reuse the cold war playbook by vilifying Putin and Russia, a proposition that makes no sense and has no relevance for many of us.  Western Putin fanboys aren't really supporting Putin, they usually know little about him.  They're supporting the fact that Putin pisses off certain people off just by existing and not being a blatant cuck like most western politicians, people who can't do anything for us that isn't in the cold war playbook.

So this brings us back to the TPP, the Euro, etc.  Unless you're a customs broker, what do these things really do for you? Do we not have enough Chinese Walmart crap and Japanese cars available already? How is running the TPP and pretending that someone like Putin wants to kill us supposed to make anything better? It doesn't make any sense but it sounds like it would be really good for making new Walmarts and new Toyotas, but if we wanted to work at those places we already would.

It's true there's plenty of stuff we don't agree on.  Not everyone wants to be a liberal and maybe white people want to be proud of their heritage too, instead of pretending that a double standard on racial pride can solve every problem.  But what difference does some of this stuff make? Gays are not going to get their relationships legally annulled, fixing the problems of poor blacks and Muslims et al. is not going to be solved in a one dimensional way.  Our ""feels"" just get in the way of making progress on things we actually agree on by dramatizing and simplifying everything.

[Discussion] My friend in another country is steadily going more Full Liberal each day and I have no idea what to do.,"His most recent email read like a liberal's fantasy. First, he threatened me for daring to take sides and insisted that because he's ""Picking and choosing"" his battles and not being ""Biased"" like me, everything I said is wrong and he's still making up his mind, but I've also disappointed him and ""That's the worst thing you can do. I'll let you off this once."". Then he espoused the virtues of his multicultural country, then insisted that all animals are killed in the halal way, even sushi and shrimp, because it's ""Just a normal way to drain blood"" and ""Killing floors are only 80% effective and the remaining animals are often brutally murdered"".
So a regular animal kill is brutal murder, but fucking hanging it upside down and letting its still-beating heart pump its blood out of its flailing neck isn't?!
And then he fucking edged at me, the edgy bitch. ""I should warn you, I could twist my neutrality to say that both sides shouldn't be allowed to exist"", he actually typed.
Then he claimed that Islam is superior to Christianity and Buddhism because they never had to fight in wars, so there's no violence in the culture, but there is in Islam because they're a proud people that had to fight against christian oppression. Fucking kill me now, please. Buddhism has no relevance here and Christianity had plenty of wars, especially the crusades they had after years of Islamic aggression and around two thirds of the world in their pocket, because back then, there were no virtue-signallers willing to get in the way of logic.
This guy used to be smart. This guy used to be fun to talk to. This guy used to be a Google Fair guy (According to him, for all I know, he could have actually been a lying turd this entire time with shitty test scores and a shittier personality). This guy was my friend for years and he helped me get through some bad times, and now, he's being sucked into a cult and I have no idea what to do.

update: He thinks ""Kosher meat"" is the one true way of preparing meat, because ""Death by electrocution"" is horribly painful
How the fuck does he not know how electric killing floors work? It's like flicking a switch and turning the animals off, the electric current kills them before their mind can even process it. They're not painfully murdered, that's just... so... wrong.

""And yes [MY NAME], if you are scared of losing me, i would suggest listening instead of subscribing to fearmongering. I will warn you. This is the point where with many others i start losing a lot of patience. But because its you, and only because of that, i will remain calm.

I too take the stance of being at peace and leaving it as it is. Its the first and most important step. I think i told you the parable before.

My Approach on Trump (and Populism),"There are beyond many reasons to not support him, his liberal populism, his pompous attitude, and ESPECCIALY his ~~asshats~~ supporters. 

So why do I ""support"" him? Well its simple, there are two fights that plague America this election year, the Social War here at home, and the Enemies abroad. With Hillary, we lose both fights, hands down, and with Trump, we may have a chance at both, maybe one, or maybe we lose both. Im willing to bet on the 50/50 but not on the 100/1. Thankfully, the priviligde to vote is not yet in my hands, so I send my blessings and support to Hopper Crowder.

So, what am I hear for? Well none other than the rotten evil core of the Trump base's support, Populism, the death of America. Nothing good can come out of populism. Why? Well, Populism, as I understand it, is the will of the people, based off of ""who can get the majority to pool towards them"" The first problem with this, is that when you are going for the most votes, something that Trump supporters not only accuse the establishment of doing, but actually like it when there ""anti-establishment"" uses the tactic. Next: can the people be trusted with this responsibility? The Short, Bitter-Sweet answe is.... No, the will of the people, can easily be a twisted evil will, and can result in crimes against humanity, and in extreme scenarios, genocide. Imagine if the will of the peopl happened to be the will of a liberal sjw group, became the postergirl for populism. I cannot trust Humanity, which is inherently both sinfull and kind, intellegent and stupid, strong and weak, to run the government, especcially when you have a canidate or group of them willing to manipulate, and a group of voters that appear willing to accept just about anything.

Its a Nightmare, because there are two words for pure, untouched Populism....

Ted Cruz was right.,"So, Politifact is claiming that when Ted Cruz made this assertion he was lying his ass off. In other words, Pants On Fire. 


[Pants on Fire: Cruz says White House sponsored U.N. resolution that would ""shred 1st Amendment""](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/may/09/ted-cruz/cruz-claims-obama-administration-sponsored-un-reso/)


However, when I read up on the history of the UN resolution I see that he is indeed right. Yes, the language was toned down and the title changed to make it more appealing. But we know how that will work. Now it's easy to interpret it however you like. It's ambiguous which is just how politicians like it.  But the basic language is STILL there and Islamic countries have stated openly that that is how they will use it and view it. It's an open door to tyranny by Islamic countries against anyone who defames Islam. Do you really think they will prosecute a Muslim for defaming Christianity? Seriously? And it's also a door to blasphemy laws right here in the USA.  

&gt;The UNHRC Resolution, originally known as ""Defamation of Islam,"" was changed in later versions -- it would seem for broader marketability -- to ""Defamation of Religions.""

&gt;Long sought by the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation, UNHRC Resolution 16/18 was co-sponsored by the United States, along with Pakistan. During a series of closed-door meetings over at least three years, it was spearheaded by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

&gt;""At the invitation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,"" begins the document of the US Mission in Geneva, ""representatives of 26 governments and four international organizations met in Washington, D.C. on December 12-14, 2011 to discuss the implementation of United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution (UNHRC) 16/18 on 'Combating Intolerance, Negative Stereotyping and Stigmatization of, and Discrimination, Incitement to Violence and Violence Against, Persons Based on Religion or Belief.'""


So, it's not law here in USA right? But remember, Hillary sponsored it. Do you really think she did this all on her own? Yes, Obama is behind this. 


Then we have this house resolution

&gt;The Resolution goes on to denounce ""...in the strongest terms the increase of hate speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those perceived to be Muslim.""


Then we have Loretta Lynch 

&gt;The reason for the introduction of this House Resolution at this point in time makes more sense if seen in conjunction with statements made by Attorney General Loretta Lynch on December 3, at a dinner celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Muslim Advocates -- an organization that, according to its own website, has ""powerful connections in Congress and the White House"" and ensures that, ""the concerns of American Muslims are heard by leaders at the highest levels of government."" Muslim Advocates goes on to say, ""As a watchdog of justice, we use the courts to bring to task those who threaten the rights of American Muslims.""


&gt;At the dinner, Attorney General Lynch stated that she is concerned about an

&gt;[""incredibly disturbing rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric...](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7176/criminalizing-free-speech) The fear that you have just mentioned is in fact my greatest fear as a prosecutor, as someone who is sworn to the protection of all of the American people, which is that the rhetoric will be accompanied by acts of violence. Now obviously, this is a country that is based on free speech, but when it edges towards violence, when we see the potential for someone lifting that mantle of anti-Muslim rhetoric -- or, as we saw after 9/11, violence directed at individuals who may not even be Muslims but perceived to be Muslims, and they will suffer just as much -- when we see that we will take action.""


Take note of the slippery language. First they always mention ""hate speech"". ""Anti-Islamic rhetoric""  Then they move to violence or violent acts or discrimination. These things are already illegal. There's no need for more laws. They include criticism of Islam as ""anti-Islamic rhetoric"". As if it's on the same level. It's legal speech. Legal free speech. No where do they mention anti-Christian rhetoric. They would have to arrest every other liberal.

Countering the Trump aberration with satire,"A fine little satire exists on Kindle, iTunes and Kobo to help mock the New York businessman. “The Anti-Trump” by novelist Michael Carin identifies Trump as a bigoted buffoon whose arrogance is outdone only by his ignorance. The book provides a literary treat in which a Seinfeld-like comedian turns absolutely solemn, runs for President expressly to counter the Trump aberration, articulates practical policies in a relentlessly cerebral manner … and thereby demolishes The Donald. This take-down of the pathological liar essentially proposes  that the Trump campaign should be mocked into oblivion.

Sotomayor Again Representing the Rabid Left,"This case didn't involve any racial aspect at all, but Sotomayor injected it.

&gt;This case involves a suspicionless stop, one in which the
officer initiated this chain of events without justification.
As the Justice Department notes, supra, at 8, many innocent
people are subjected to the humiliations of these
unconstitutional searches. The white defendant in this
case shows that anyone’s dignity can be violated in this
manner. See M. Gottschalk, Caught 119–138 (2015). But
it is no secret that people of color are disproportionate
victims of this type of scrutiny. See M. Alexander, The
New Jim Crow 95–136 (2010). For generations, black and
brown parents have given their children “the talk”—
instructing them never to run down the street; always
keep your hands where they can be seen; do not even
think of talking back to a stranger—all out of fear of how
an officer with a gun will react to them. See, e.g., W. E. B.
Du Bois, The Souls of Black Folk (1903); J. Baldwin, The
Fire Next Time (1963); T. Coates, Between the World and
Me (2015).

As if whites don't talk to their kids about how to avoid negative interactions with the police. Even Ginsburg couldn't bring herself to join this part of the opinion.

1. Recent testimony by Steven A. Camarota, Ph.D. Director of Research at Center for Immigration Studies in front of the US Civil Rights commission testified[ in front of the Senate in March 2016 illustrating that illegal immigration has affected black males]( http://cis.org/Testimony/Camarota-The-Impact-of-Large-Scal-%20Immigration-on-American-Workers) disproportionately and influenced rates of violent crime. 

2. Also  U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Peter Kirsanow testified at the same hearing in March 2016 that [“The evidence that we gathered shows that, unequivocally, the wage and unemployment levels of black Americans are disproportionately adversely affected by illegal immigration, particularly when it pertains to the effect on black males,](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/the-impact-of-high-levels-of-immigration-on-us-workers)” Kirsanow told the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on immigration and the national interest.




1. A 2008 congressional study from the Commission Civil Rights on called [The Impact of Illegal Immigration on the Wages and Employment Opportunities of Black Workers](http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1756&amp;context=key_workplace) revealed that the last 30-40 years of illegal immigration has impacted poor and unemployed communities even more than other demographics. This is striking because after the 60s was the time for black communities to try and gain some economic foothold in the country, facing competition from scores of unskilled low-wage workers has removed jobs once done by mostly minorities in to the hands of those competing for entry level employment. 

2. In 2005 Vicente Fox caused a firestorm of controversy when he visited the United States and effectively said that ""[mexicans do the jobs not even blacks will do](https://youtu.be/2T6PHBlUg3U)"" and [then refused to apologize](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/05/16/mexico-fox-wont-apologize-for-racial-comment.html). 

3. Vicinte Fox's comments are problematic on many levels and reinforce stereotypes and false truths. This implies that black workers are lazy when in fact there is evidence that [black labor unions have complained that market forces favoring illegals in major cities like Los Angeles have forced prevented them from being able to compete](http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/20/local/me-guestworker20)

3.

4. Illegal immigrants have shifted their plight from legality to emotional appeals to [change the nomenclature of their status from illegal alien](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/should-i-use-the-term-illegal-immigrant) to the recent democrat debate where Jorge Ramos just calls them ""immigrants"" and piggybacked the black civil rights movement for mere acknowledgment and opportunity as citizens

5. Black illegal immigrants are functionally not even 1% of estimated illegals and those who are are technically more ""legitimate"" since most of them had papers or visas who expired...not just completed undocumented. This useful [infographic highlights several of these trends](http://immigration.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000845) and illustrates that black illegal immigration is a drop in the bucket and effectively inconsequential

6. Black LEGAL immigrants are among the most educated of all LEGAL immigrants yet the most unemployed http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/03/black_immigrants_an_invisible.html

7. Its harder for black LEGAL immigrants to get to the USA because not only do you have to have some asset to get to the USA like money or an education, you have to win a shrinking number of lottery spots from a small number of countries. https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2012/12/20/48571/5-fast-facts-about-black-immigrants-in-the-united-states/

8. The jobs done by illegal immigrants can't keep being considered as just insignificantly low because many illegals are known to send money back to their families...its clearly enough to not only live on, but to raise generations of those spread across borders. Additionally, many American people have been able to provide for their families using these same jobs and improve the prospects for their children using these humble employment opportunities 

9. There is documented evidence that in certain cities, black construction jobs have effectively been wiped out due to the impact of illegal workers undercutting demographics just trying to earn legitimate wages and income. Some industries like working in [seafood plants have effectively removed all of their black employment in favor of mostly mexican women](http://www.nationalcenter.org/P21PR-Immigration_Blacks_092214.html)

Even several recent comments by latino media personalities highlight this such as those by [Rodner Figueroa](http://www.tmz.com/2015/03/12/univision-host-fired-rodner-figueroa-racist-comments-michelle-obama/) and [several other academic investigations](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/opinion/enrique-krauze-latin-americas-talent-for-tolerance.html) into the issue.

11. The policy towards black refugees is entirely politicized and does not benefit black illegal immigrants from countries like Haiti instead of favoring those from [Cuba and other latin american countries.](http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/08/11/demonstrators-participate-in-haitian-immigration-protest/)

12. There is effectively [no help from the NAACP](http://www.naacp.org/blog/entry/the-immigration-movement-advancing-social-and-economic-justice-for-all) OR [the Congressional Black Caucus](http://www.npr.org/2013/04/29/179829143/could-immigration-reform-plan-hurt-black-workers) who try to over-liberalize the discussion and group Black American concerns into those of ""minorities"" effectively diluting the interests of black americans who need specific set asides to address chronic unemployment in the face of an already endemically racist environment in the last several decades. However, [local versions and chapters of the NAACP have even pushed back against some illegal immigrant reform proposals](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/NAACP-Opposes-Prince-Georges-County-Schools-for-Immigrant-Students-277157141.html) under the guise that locally, black students are still being displaced in the context of larger agendas. This suggests a fracture in the overall narrative of the representation and ideas endemic to African-Americans

13. Some media entities  as [BuzzFeed News]( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-liberal-case-against-illegal-immigration.html) have called out illegal immigrations impacts on black americans with varying degrees of success, [including president Obama in his 2006 book](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/26/obama-amnesty-greater-threat-to-blacks-than-police/?page=all)

14. Youth unemployment in urban areas would radically be tackled by macroeconomic pushes to secure opportunities for black kids as noted by other analysts including remarks from [Frank Morris PhD (Chairman of the Board, Diversity Alliance for a 
  Sustainable America) before the US House of Representatives](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108hhrg92672/html/CHRG-108hhrg92672.htm).

15. Ex-cons/felons who need employment have been railroaded by an oversupply of illegal immigrants competing for the same positions and in some cases creating a culture where minorities and non-spanish speakers can't compete for the same jobs...thus indirectly contributing to relapses into crime. 

14. I don't want to mandate that blacks be only good for service industries, but its obvious that several of these jobs could be filled by and were historically filled by african americans seeking entry level employment.  Other industries like temp labor have shut out americans, especially poor and unemployed demographics that are overwhelmingly black in favor of the [fraudulent employment of illegal immigrants in cities like Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waeMkka60po)

15. As homeownership is a huge vehicle to long term economic stability, banks like [Wells Fargo have specifically announced programs meant to benefit latinos seeking to buy homes](https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2015/hispanic-wealth-project_0915/), while mostly [black homeowners get only acknowledgement and preferential assistance AFTER class-action lawsuits and court settlements](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/) settle cases against their economic enfranchisement. 

16. Throughout the nation's history, [black americans have been shut out of equal and fair employment](http://capitalresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LW1406-final-for-posting-140528.pdf) as a function of both narratives of white supremacy and outright discrimination in well documented and thorough cases dating back to the literary cessation of slavery



****

Now...I have tons of problems with the **LEGAL** system including visas, fees, tests, the amount of time and processing, conditions for family members, how certain industries are presented and lottery issues...And the time to debate that will be another thread/topic.

...however...

when it comes to illegal immigration, African-Americans in the USA need better representation and more equitable acknowledgement about the outright attack illegal immigration has placed before black economic sustainability and development. 

When 80% of illegals are employed I must wonder if people really think that there aren't as many of millions of our own poor and disenfranchised who would do the same work, if not for the illegal wages being offered.

...And this isn't just about hispanics, apparently asian illegal immigration has competitively challenged immigration from central and south america as the prime offender of bringing in substantial numbers of illegal immigrants

To all NeverTrumpers still out there: please consider this after today's ruling,"Today's Supreme Court ruling highlights the true power of the SCOTUS when it comes to checks and balances. Barack Obama's plan to protect 4 million illegal immigrants from deportation was shot down in a 4-4 vote. 

The true significance of this- the scary thing, is that four justices voted in favor of it. Four justices who took an oath to uphold the laws and constitution of the United States voted to uphold regulations keeping illegal immigrants safe. 

If just one more justice is appointed by HRC, the system that has kept Barack Obama in check (mostly- i.e today) will tip into her favor, effectively meaning she can get away with all the unconstitutional garbage that she wants. 

Say what you want about Trump- maybe he isn't as conservative as you'd like. He's certainly no Reagan. But he has released a list of Supreme Court nominees that are all DEFINITELY conservatives. 

If you stand against Trump's policies, here's to hoping the Supreme Court keeps him checked too ;).

 But, please, if nothing else, think of the repercussions of Scalia's seat going to a HRC appointed justice. Trump will hold the executive office, maybe you don't like that- but the SC can change the country forever and that would be much worse.

"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: May 1, 2016 Edition","Obama Calls His Management of the US Economy ""Best in Human History""

Despite declines in labor force participation, family income and home ownership juxtaposed to increases in poverty, debt, and health care costs, President Obama maintains that his Administration ""probably managed the American economy better than any large economy on Earth in human history.""

The President lambasted critics who cite GDP statistics that show Obama to be the only president that has failed to deliver even a single year of 3% growth—making his the worst performing administration since Herbert Hoover's during the early years of the Great Depression. ""Growth and prosperity aren't the only metrics by which we should judge what has transpired,"" Obama argued. ""Under my policies millions of Americans have been able to escape the rat race of wage-slavery and enjoy massive amounts of leisure time. Not since Lincoln have so many been liberated.""

Obama singled out the movie The Big Short for special criticism calling its portrayal of the collapse of bad real estate loans ""one sided. The narrow focus on the inability of lenders to make payments on their loans overlooks the fact that it was government pressure on the banks that enabled poor credit risks to join the ranks of home owners, if albeit only temporarily. Isn't it better to have owned and lost than never to have owned at all?""

""The real problem is that the banking reforms put in place by the Clinton Administration didn't go far enough,"" Obama contended. ""If we had just taken that next logical step of eliminating the necessity to repay those mortgage loans we could have averted the foreclosure crisis that tipped the economy into recession in 2008.""

Denmark Plagued by Migrant Crime Wave

The generosity of Danes opening their borders to immigrants from Muslim countries has been repaid by an astounding surge in crimes committed by these foreigners. Though these foreigners make up only 8% of the country's population they account for over 75% of the crimes committed and over 80% of those drawing unemployment benefits from the government.

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has frequently offered up Denmark as an exemplar of the kind of social policies we ought to adopt in the United States, professed himself ""not the least bit disturbed by these results. Compared to the places these immigrants came from, Denmark is a very rich country. The redistribution of Danish wealth, whether by informal appropriation via theft or though the more organized method of taxation and funding of welfare benefits brings that country closer to the ideal of social justice.""

""No one who has more than they need has the moral right to withhold that excess from others who have less,"" Sanders maintained. ""Of course it is preferable that government oversee the transfer of material goods from the haves to the have-nots, but we mustn't be too harsh on those who grow impatient waiting for government to do the right thing and take action on their own.""

In related news, anti-Trump Latinos shouting ""make America Mexico again"" went on a violent rampage bloodying Trump supporters and smashing car windows following the GOP candidate's rally in Costa Mesa, California this week. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton blamed Trump ""for creating the environment that inspires the desperate and dispossessed to resort to violence to achieve their objectives"" and vowed to end the violence ""by showing them that when I am president government will be on their side.""

EPA Refuses to Pay Damages for Its Toxic Spill

Colorado Republicans blasted the EPA after an agency official refused to cover the full cost of damages done by the EPA's release of toxic sludge from the Gold King Mine last August contaminated water supplies in Colorado and New Mexico after spreading from the Animas River to the San Juan River.

EPA official Bill Murray explained that ""people need to understand that when we took responsibility for the spill we were making a moral statement, not agreeing to compensate anyone for any injuries suffered. The government has 'sovereign immunity' and cannot be held liable without its consent. Obviously, we are not consenting to the demands of those who have been harmed by our actions.""

Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo) characterized Murray's stance as ""outrageous"" and ""another example of the Washington double standard. If a private firm or individual had been responsible for a spill of this magnitude the EPA would be coming down hard on them and demanding they make restitution to the victims of their negligence.""

Murray countered by insisting that ""the double standard is fully justified by the different motivations of private parties and the government. Private parties are out for profit. Imposing substantial monetary penalties on them is a useful and necessary corrective to their selfish behaviors. Government, on the other hand, is non-profit. Its concern is with the general welfare. Consequently, there is no need for financial penalties to be used in order to get government to do the right thing. It will do this on its own.""

In related news, the EPA defied a Supreme Court stay against the agency's global warming Clean Power Plan (CPP). EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy asserted that ""the Court's ruling is merely a legal opinion. The President has a different opinion. Under our Constitution's separation of powers he believes he is not obligated to submit to subjugation by either of the other two branches of our government. He will not willingly submit and there is no mechanism for the Court compel him to do so.""

Hillary Floats Pair of Controversial Ideas

In a bid to solidify her leftist credentials, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton floated a couple of ridiculous ideas about how this country will improve when she is president.

On the urban violence front, Clinton proposes to ""reset"" the relationship between police and street gangs. ""The knee jerk attitude of the average American toward urban gangs is that they are a bad thing,"" she observed. ""What they overlook is that joining a gang is like having a family. It's feeling like you're part of something bigger than yourself. I think this is a positive thing. Another positive is that the youngsters learn valuable lessons like loyalty and how to handle weapons.""

""The problem is that these gangs operate outside of the law,"" she continued. ""We need to find a way of bringing them under the umbrella of the government's authorized use of force if society is to capitalize on the skills these young people have learned as gang members. I believe President Obama's idea of establishing a national police force would offer these otherwise outlaws an alternate path within the context of our social justice objectives.""

On the domestic violence front, Clinton proposes ""to expand upon the great strides President Obama has made in changing attitudes towards abortion. Ensuring that all heath insurance must cover abortions has compelled everyone to bear the burden of funding this vital human right. Nevertheless, many still voice opinions criticizing the practice. Women are subjected to the torment of being emotionally traumatized by the fear that fellow citizens may disapprove of their choice. We need to turn this around so every woman can feel pride in her decision to exterminate an unwanted fetus in her body. Perhaps a presidential medal that could be given on an annual basis to the woman who makes the most courageous decision for abortion would help change how abortion is perceived in the minds of the average person.""

Trump Foreign Policy Speech Alarms Allies

GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's emphasis that the guiding principle for foreign policy under his administration will be ""America first"" has made some of our European allies nervous.

Germany's foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier characterized Trump's stance as ""arrogant and selfish. To put America first is offensive to my ears. He is denying our equality and our right to participate in determining what America must do to protect all of our mutual interests. If this kind of self-centered viewpoint had prevailed in an earlier era my country and perhaps all of western Europe would today be run by fascists or communists.""

Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister concurred. ""Trump is disrespecting democratic processes and democratic values,"" Bildt charged. ""He makes no provision for our vote. Becoming America's president won't make him king. He would not have the prerogative to shrug off the obligations the United States has assumed and on which the rest of the free world has depended for three-quarters of a century without our acquiescence.""

British Prime Minister David Cameron said ""Trump's demand that we be required to fund a minimum share of the cost of our defense is unprecedented. This is not how things have been done for more than seven decades. We haven't budgeted for the kind of outlays this would entail. We can't afford it.""

German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel suggested that ""our only viable option might be to call a President Trump's bluff. If we look like we'll be overrun by communists, fascists, or Islamists the United States would have to come to our rescue. Otherwise they'd be left alone to face an entire world hostile to their own survival.""

In related news, President Obama praised Germany's ""open door"" policy on refugees from the Middle East, saying ""it has set an example that others should follow. If the various different ethnic and religious peoples were more uniformly dispersed around the globe the incentives for nations to fight one another would be diminished.""

The point is that if Trump is the nominee, conservatives will have no voice in this election, whereas if we have a 3rd party or independent conservative candidate in the race, we will have a voice.

The Conservative Intellectual: Resources for defending Conservatism,"**Introduction**

Hello my fellow conservatives, I am having a lot of fun on this subreddit discussing Conservatism with you guys. Often I am surprised by the amount of coherence and good argumentation skills. However, just like every other group, we all have our failings and weaknesses in argumentation. In order to beat the left, we must move past their character assassination techniques and destroy them with intellectual superiority and might. This involves being educated on the arguments for Conservatism as a whole. 

Now I know better than to pidgin hole all Conservatives into one group so I used this: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/conservative-vs-liberal-beliefs/

To determine which beliefs are conservative, I have not took all of the issues simply because then I would have an enormous list. From this I developed a comprehensive conservative intellectual resource list on the common problems of today. I have tried to stay free with the resources but unfortunately the best works are paid. Also none of these works are religious arguments.

"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: March 13, 2016 Edition","Dem Candidates Agree on Abortion

The two Democratic contenders for the Party's 2016 presidential nomination fended off the possibility that states should have any leeway in limiting abortions carried out within their borders.

In a statement eerily similar to the Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton argued that ""fetuses are creatures of an inferior order. They are not persons under the law or Constitution. Consequently, the imputation of their imaginary so-called right to life cannot displace the very real right of the mother to the liberty to not be encumbered with the burdens of pregnancy and child care that anti-choice fanatics would seek to impose on her.""

""The right established by the Court in its historic Roe vs. Wade decision would be meaningless if state legislatures are allowed to chip away at them,"" Clinton added. ""Mandatory ultrasounds, 72-hour waiting periods, and prohibition of late term abortions are all infringements on a woman's fundamental right against being forced to bear a child.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders (S-Vt) concurred with Clinton's stance and lamented that ""the resurrection of the discredited claim that powers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states would be used for such a disgraceful objective. Minority women are disproportionate beneficiaries of the right to an abortion. How are attempts to limit these rights not seen as racist?""

Sanders vowed to ""appoint Supreme Court Justices that will protect and broaden the rights granted by Roe vs. Wade beyond the artificial birth threshold. Merely surviving the journey down the birth canal is no great accomplishment. It must not be used as an argument for bestowing a whole roster of rights and privileges to the entity that emerges if the mother opposes the continued existence of this entity.""

In related news, Governor Earl Ray Tomblin (D-WV) vetoed a bill banning dismemberment abortions. ""The Supreme Court has determined that every woman has a Constitutional right to an abortion,"" Tomblin declared. ""Opposition to a procedure that fulfills this right is an attempt to impose a restriction. The contention that the pain of being torn limb from limb somehow validates such a restriction usurps this fundamental right.""

DOJ Considering Prosecuting ""Climate Deniers""

The US Department of Justice is exploring ways of ""bringing climate change deniers to justice,"" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch in Senate testimony. ""Global climate change represents the most severe threat to humanity that has ever existed. It is imperative that we be united in the struggle against this menace. Yet, there are elements of society that undermine this necessary unity by casting doubt in people's minds. We must put a stop to that.""

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) urged the DOJ ""to use all the tools at its disposal, including civil forfeiture and criminal sanctions, against these abettors of planetary disaster. We need to send a stern message that doubters will not have free rein to mislead and confuse the American public with their erroneous and nonconforming opinions.""

Using the government's action against tobacco manufacturers as a model, Whitehouse demanded ""a vigorous prosecution of these despoilers of Mother Earth. We are far beyond the stage where mere warning labels will suffice. The pain of financial destitution and imprisonment must be meted out to the producers, consumers, and defenders of the fossil fuel industry and its products.""

Lynch thanked the Senator for his ""passionate advocacy for the planet and willingness to embrace the harsh measures that will be necessary to win this battle,"" but also reminded that ""there is only so much we can do in the time remaining before the next administration takes office in 2017. If we are to save the planet it is imperative that a Democrat succeed President Obama in office. The risk that a Republican president might undo the progress we've made by using a 'freedom of speech' excuse in order to shield deniers would be a setback that cannot be tolerated.""

In other DOJ news, Lynch rebuffed suggestions that a criminal referral from the FBI on Hillary Clinton's email infractions would compel her to prosecute the former Secretary of State. ""The decision on whether to take action against anyone is a matter of pure discretion,"" she asserted. ""Simple violation of a criminal statute is not dispositive. If, in our judgment, justice would be better served by ignoring the infraction we are fully authorized to decline to carry the case forward.""

Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (Fla) confirmed that ""I have been assured by both President Obama and Attorney General Lynch that there will be no prosecution for any crimes Secretary Clinton may have committed in the course of her service in the Administration or on the campaign trail.""

Obama Denies Responsibility for Divisiveness

President Barack Obama denied responsibility for any role he might have had in the disagreements roiling the American population during the current election campaign.

""Look, the voters elected me as their president,"" he pointed out. ""I was the one with the mandate to lead. It is those who have resisted acquiescence in my leadership who are the source of the divisiveness afflicting the country. Is it the parent who lays down the law that is at fault? Or is is the unruly child who defies the parent that should be held responsible for the disruption and disobedience?""

The President blamed ""talk radio for inciting the opposition and rebellion that have encouraged too many Americans to actively criticize and resist the progressive changes the majority of Americans want. Access to the public airways is something that the Federal Communications Commission could've done a better job at controlling. Clearly, the daily castigation of my policies and person by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and others is an abuse of a privilege that would be better exercised by seeking ways to help the government carry out the actions needed to advance the collective welfare of all Americans.""

Obama cited the GOP presidential candidates' rhetoric as ""proof of how dissident elements are wrecking our community. We repeatedly hear the phrase 'repeal and replace' when we should be hearing 'extend and expand' when the GOP candidates are talking about the advances made under my administration. They are the ones dividing the country. Perhaps I should've been less lenient and taken stronger steps to dampen overt expressions of discontent, disagreement, and disobedience. Maybe that's a lesson the next president can learn from.""

Signs that the next president may have learned this lesson were exhibited when Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton labeled criticism of the Obama Administration's achievements ""un-American trafficking in prejudice and paranoia. At this point in our history it is important that all those who would seek to lead this great nation be on the same page with the progress already made over the last seven years. Will voters endorse a candidate who will continue on this path or will they be duped into electing a GOP wrecker? That is the big question this year's election must answer.""

Sanders Says Castro ""More Good than Bad""

In this week's Democratic presidential debate Sen. Bernie Sanders (S-Vt) defended his past praise of Castro's Cuban dictatorship.

""A lot of critics, especially those on the right, overlook the positive things Fidel Castro did for the Cuban people,"" Sanders said. ""Under Castro's leadership the Cuban people got education and universal health care. I think this compares very favorably with what the American people got over the same time period.""

Sanders acknowledged that ""the Castro regime may not have been democratic as we normally use that term, but for most people the material gains achieved by the regime were probably worth more than the theoretical benefits of free speech that they didn't have. The number of people imprisoned or executed for opposing the government was tiny compared to the number who benefited from the free education and free health care.""

An example of the health care advantages in Cuba, according to Sanders, are the ubiquitous bread lines. ""Apologists for capitalistic excesses frequently use the prevalence of bread lines to mock socialistic economies,"" Sanders recounted. ""What they want everyone to ignore is the fact that bread is loaded with gluten. Restricting people's access to bread improves their health.""

The Senator pointed to the enthusiasm generated by his campaign as evidence that ""the American people would gladly exchange the intangible rights protected by the Bill of Rights for the tangible benefits of free college and free health care. Freedom of speech doesn't guarantee you a good job. Freedom of religion doesn't put food on your table. Why should mindless adoration of these 200-year-old artifacts take precedence over the more meaningful rights a Sanders Administration will bestow upon every man, woman, and child?""

In related news, the Cuban regime advised President Obama ""to bring his checkbook with him when he comes to our country next week. We are gratified that he has renounced the 50 years of oppression the United States has imposed on Cuba. Now it is time to make reparations for the deprivation these imperialistic policies imposed upon our nation.""

Hillary Proposes DOE SWAT Team

As a counter to poor performance by America's public schools, Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton proposed to set up a Department of Education ""SWAT"" Team that would be dispatched to crackdown on errant educators.

""The problem with our system of public schools is that false doctrines and anti-government attitudes are allowed to exist without consequence,"" Clinton complained. ""An ill-advised autonomy for teachers and local schools has served to shield purveyors of anti-social doctrines from the discipline needed to ensure proper inculcation of collective values. Under my plan the Secretary of Education will be empowered to send a special weapons and tactics team to suppress any deviant excursions from the accepted common core curriculum.""

According to the candidate, the special weapons and tactics will include ""the power to terminate any offending teacher regardless of any contractual impediments. Tenure should not protect a teacher who contradicts the progressive agenda. Likewise, local control will be overridden whenever it conflicts with the objectives set by the DOE.""

The truly bad thing about the Trump protest,"America has been divided for a while, so it isn't that. The political discourse in the country has also gone downhill, partially due to Trump but also due to political correctness going too far in general. The truly sad thing is that dictators in China, the Middle East, and other countries will point to this and say that Democracy doesn't work. They'll say that even Americans aren't able to be trusted with deciding on their own leaders and their own rules, without it breaking down into rioting. This argument is already being made, so now it became just that much more legitimate. I'm sure excepts from this rally will be shown on CCTV.

"Far too many ""American"" companies are subsidiaries of foreign corporations.","A perfect example is Entenmann's, a company which people simply assume is American because its always found in American supermarkets. Although the company was founded in America, it was sold to a Mexican company in 2008. Another example is Sprint. Its still technically an American company, but a Japanese bank owns 80% of it. Than there's Bud, which is listed as a domestic beer. Although it's manufactured in the USA, it's owned by a European company.

I could go on and on listing various companies, however the simplest solution is for you to simply view the Wikipedia page of any company and simply click the link for the parent company. However, even this can be tricky, since the parent company can itself be a subsidiary of an even larger company.

Possibly the greatest examples are the YMCA and the Red Cross. Both of these non-profit organizations are based in Switzerland. I suppose it's different with charities, but I figured I'd mention it anyway.

I don't believe prejudice is the root of racial issues in society. What do you think?,"I don't know if this is the best sub for this, but I figured it was the best place I know of to have a reasonable discussion on the issue.

I made a realization when I was talking with someone about racism/prejudice... The problem really isn't that we make assumptions about people. Some assumptions are just based on feelings, which, yes, that is wrong. But assumptions based on statistics and experiences are not as wrong. Statistics is a tool that can be used for good or bad, and assumptions aren't wrong by definition. The real source of harm in terms of prejudice and racism is when people create a culture that's centered around some part of their biology, like their skin color, and then that culture becomes harmful to others. When that becomes so common, then people who have that skin color, but aren't part of the culture lose some of their reputation because of it, or people say ""don't criticize their culture, because it sounds like you're criticizing them for something they can't change, i.e. their skin color"". Then it just gets worse, because people feel justified in having a harmful culture.

So in short, the current mentality that it's wrong to criticize someone's culture or how they act because it might be considered racist, is a mentality that will promote more harmful cultures, more reaction to them, and more claims of racism. The only way to fix this is to strongly distinguish whenever possible, that someone's actions or culture are harmful, not their race, and work to fix those actions/culture, and work to separate this culture-race associativity.

It seems kind of self-explanatory now that I've written it all out, but I don't think I ever really identified before that the root of all of the racial issues was the culture-race associativity.

How we got here -- some thoughts,"People and parties hold power through the treasure and mechanics of government, but can only capture that power initially if the culture and cultural signaling they represent is strong enough. Put another way: Politics is a trailing indicator and voting is a defensive action. In contrast, creating and deploying culture is an offensive maneuver.

The left understands this better than the right.

The center-left generally speaks directly into the microphone of the larger culture; the right (increasingly, even the establishment right) takes a misplaced outsider's pride in talking primarily to itself. Mainstreaming vs. walled gardens.

And each side is doing what works. They just have different end games in mind.
In the U.S., liberal (in the modern sense of he word) grand strategy has been to incrementally move the needle to a new normal, advancing even heretofore radical ideas as completely moderate and appropriate when a cultural and political window opened. 

Conservative grand strategy is different -- it has grown smaller even as its infrastructure has grown larger, evolving from the curation and adoption of classic principles and cultural mores to something resembling a bunker mentality.

And both sides have their bastard offspring.

For the left, the grand strategy worked so effectively and for so long that a new generation of progressive activists treats its near-complete anschluss of American culture as a fusty old status quo that has to be poked and intimidated, while at the same time demanding safe harbor from (and even recompense over) the slightest difference in viewpoint. It is the fury of palace toddlers, surrounded in generations of wealth and comfort yet raging and inconsolable without one more special blankie.

Similarly, the bad seed of the modern conservative movement is the growth of the noisemaker class -- people and institutions whose raison d'etre isn't solving problems or exporting transformative culture but simply keeping things agitated. Fear is their primary cultural output, followed by tribalism.

All of this comes to mind because many are acting like the Trump candidacy is some sort of black-swan event -- a confluence of things we couldn't understand, predict or prepare for.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

The left spent years treating dissent from their orthodoxy as increasingly intolerable; the right spent an equal amount of time moving from a focus on our potential to an obsession with our decline. For both sides, people, positions and even cultures are no longer things to be merely disagreed with -- The Other's adherents must be personally attacked and their beliefs labeled unsafe.

MoveOn.org sent out this email today. Absolutely insane.,"Dear fellow MoveOn member,

I’m Heather McGhee, president of Demos, a progressive think tank and MoveOn ally.

**Last night in Chicago, peaceful demonstrators responded to increasingly hateful and violent rhetoric from Donald Trump.** But that violence isn't coming out of nowhere, and it isn't just inside the Trump campaign. It's the predictable outcome of years of dog-whistle politics which use hate and fear as a political tool.

For the past 40 years, the right wing has peddled a winning strategy to keep Americans divided: sell the economic agenda of the 1% to working- and middle-class white voters through a hidden formula:

Fear People of Color --&gt; Hate Government --&gt; Trust the Market and the 1%

And they've been selling us this agenda even as it has hurt Americans of all races whose wages have plummeted and whose economic insecurity has soared.

[Will you take three minutes to watch and share We Must Talk About Race to Fix Economic Inequality, a new video I've made with my colleague Ian Haney López in partnership with MoveOn?](https://act.moveon.org/go/2076?t=1&amp;akid=163030.33340595.nSB-BN) Especially now, as Trump's hate speech washes across the country, drawing out and inflaming deep-seated racism, it's important for all of us to have the tools we need to fight back.
 
Donald Trump's tactics exist in a historical context. Ronald Reagan was able to draw millions of former Democrats to the GOP with this race-baiting formula. He gave us the fictional character of the Black ""welfare queen"" to prey on resentment against struggling African-American families, but the real targets were government and labor unions. Why? Because these are the only public institutions powerful enough to hold corporations and the wealthy accountable.

The result? No Democrat has won the majority of white voters since Lyndon Johnson. Further, this has lead to ""The Inequality Era"": corporations writing their own rules, tax cuts for the wealthiest, slashed social spending, and unions on the ropes.

Politicians like Trump are using the same playbook today—whether it’s blatant attacks on immigrants or subtle coded language like ""makers and takers"" and ""free stuff"" to pit white voters against people of color and undermine our willingness to fight together for progressive solutions that work for all of us.

This scheme to use race to divide Americans who would otherwise be united in their economic goals is the best-kept secret in American politics—everyone knows it's true, but few political leaders are willing to address it head-on. That's why I teamed up with UC Berkeley law professor and author of Dog Whistle Politics, Ian Haney López, my colleague at Demos, to tell this story of how racism fuels economic inequality and what we can do about it. We’ve made a video with MoveOn that makes it easy to learn and share this call to action over social media and email.

We can’t win against economic inequality without understanding the right’s best weapon against a unified 99%. Everything progressives want—debt-free college, universal health care, campaign finance rules, climate change solutions, workers’ rights—requires a belief in government and trust in each other. We are better than this, and we won’t stand for politicians denying the humanity and worth of our fellow Americans. Our future depends on creating a multiracial progressive movement that will fight for racial and economic justice together, and we are ready.

tl;dr:  Trump is a racist and the Chicago ""protesters"" were peaceful.  

These people are abso-fucking-lutely insane.  Some of them know the score, but the fact that those in the know are able to recruit so many useful idiots to do their dirty work for them is difficult to believe.  Our terrible education system is almost certainly by design... the puppet masters cannot advance their globalist agenda without legions of the foolish.
